## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap creation: Derived 9 phases from 32 requirements using comprehensive depth setting
- Validation-first approach: Phases 1-5 establish infrastructure before fixes in Phases 6-8
- Parallel foundation work: Phase 1 (GUI) and Phase 2 (Test suite) can proceed in parallel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 3 (CI/CD):** Requires Windows runner for SCMP.exe (original compiler is Windows-only)
**Phase 6-8 (Decompiler Fixes):** Success depends on comprehensive error classification from Phase 4
