# Phase 5: Metrics Dashboard - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** SKIPPED

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Originally scoped: Dashboard to track compilation success rates, semantic equivalence, error patterns, and test coverage trends over time.

## Implementation Decision

**PHASE SKIPPED BY USER CHOICE**

Rationale: This project has a finite scope — fix the decompiler to produce high-quality output, then decompile a specific set of scripts. Long-term metrics tracking infrastructure is not aligned with this goal.

**What we have instead:**
- Phase 4 already provides error analysis tools (error categorization, pattern aggregation, interactive viewer)
- Existing test suite shows current compilation status
- No need for historical trend tracking or GUI dashboards

**User guidance:** "Focus just on fixing and improving the decompiler output."

**Next step:** Proceed directly to Phase 6 (Expression Reconstruction Fixes) to improve decompiler quality.
