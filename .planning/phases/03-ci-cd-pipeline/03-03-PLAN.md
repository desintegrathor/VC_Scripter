<objective>
Configure branch protection to require validation passing before merge, test complete CI flow end-to-end, and verify regression detection works correctly.

Purpose: Ensures broken code cannot be merged by making validation a required status check. Complete end-to-end testing validates the CI pipeline catches regressions as intended before relying on it in production.

Output: Production-ready CI/CD pipeline with enforced quality gates and verified regression detection.

  feat(03-02): add GitHub Actions CI pipeline with regression baselines

  - GitHub Actions workflow for automated validation on push/PR
  - pytest plugins for CI integration (annotations, JSON reports, baselines)
  - Baseline regression testing to detect previously-passing scripts failing
  - Test result artifacts with 30-day retention
  - Self-hosted Windows runner targeting for SCMP.exe access

  Requirements: VALID-05, TEST-06

  This push will trigger the first workflow run on the main branch, which is necessary before configuring branch protection (per RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1).

  Wait for workflow to complete (check GitHub Actions tab).

  <how-to-verify>
  Navigate to: https://github.com/[username]/VC_Scripter/actions
  (Replace [username] with your GitHub username)

  Verify the workflow run:
  1. **Workflow name**: "Decompilation Validation"
  2. **Trigger**: "push" event on main branch
  3. **Status**: Should complete (green check or red X - both are acceptable)
  4. **Job name**: "validate" appears in the job list
  5. **Runner**: Shows "self-hosted" label (not "ubuntu-latest")

  Click into the workflow run and check:
  - "Setup Python 3.13" step succeeded
  - "Install dependencies" step succeeded
  - "Run validation tests" step executed (may fail - that's OK, tests are expected to fail)
  - "Upload test results" step succeeded (artifacts uploaded)
  - Artifacts section shows "test-results-[number]" downloadable artifact

  Expected state:
  - Workflow completed (regardless of test pass/fail)
  - Artifacts uploaded successfully
  - Job "validate" visible in GitHub (needed for branch protection)

  Common issues:
  - If runner shows "Queued": Check self-hosted runner is online in Settings > Actions > Runners
  - If "Setup Python" fails: Runner may need Python 3.13 installed locally
  - If tests fail: Expected - decompiler has bugs, we're just verifying CI infrastructure works

  Run pytest locally with baseline regeneration to create initial baseline files:

  ```bash
  cd "C:\Users\flori\source\repos\VC_Scripter"

  # Run baseline regression tests (will auto-generate YAML baselines on first run)
  py -m pytest vcdecomp/tests/test_validation.py::test_decompilation_validation_with_baseline -v

  # Baselines auto-generated in .planning/baselines/test_validation/
  # Commit them to Git for version control
  git add .planning/baselines/
  git status
  ```

  pytest-regressions will create one YAML file per parametrized test case:
  - test_decompilation_validation_with_baseline_tt_turntable_.yml
  - test_decompilation_validation_with_baseline_tdm_deathmatch_.yml
  - test_decompilation_validation_with_baseline_level_script_.yml

  These baselines capture current test outcomes. Future test runs will compare against these baselines to detect regressions.

  <action>Configure branch protection rule requiring validation</action>
  <instructions>
  Branch protection requires manual GitHub UI configuration (no API for self-hosted org repos):

  1. Navigate to: https://github.com/[username]/VC_Scripter/settings/branches
     (Replace [username] with your GitHub username)

  2. Click "Add branch protection rule"

  3. Configure protection rule:
     - **Branch name pattern**: `main`
     - Check: "Require status checks to pass before merging"
       - Check: "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
       - Search for and select: "validate" (should appear in dropdown after workflow ran)
         - If "validate" doesn't appear, refresh page or wait - GitHub only shows checks that ran on main in last 7 days
     - Check: "Require a pull request before merging" (optional but recommended)
       - Uncheck "Require approvals" (solo project, no reviewers)

  4. Scroll to bottom and click "Create" button

  Expected state:
  - Branch protection rule active on main
  - "validate" check required for merge
  - PRs will be blocked if validation fails

  Troubleshooting:
  - If "validate" not in dropdown: Ensure workflow ran successfully on main (previous checkpoint)
  - If dropdown empty: Workflow may need to run again - push empty commit to trigger
  </instructions>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete CI/CD pipeline with branch protection and regression detection</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  Test the complete CI flow with a pull request:

  **Step 1: Create test branch with intentional regression**
  ```bash
  cd "C:\Users\flori\source\repos\VC_Scripter"
  git checkout -b test-ci-regression

  # Modify baseline to simulate regression
  # Edit .planning/baselines/test_validation/test_decompilation_validation_with_baseline_tt_turntable_.yml
  # Change one value (e.g., error_count: 0 -> 999)
  ```

  **Step 2: Commit and push test branch**
  ```bash
  git add .planning/baselines/test_validation/test_decompilation_validation_with_baseline_tt_turntable_.yml
  git commit -m "test: simulate regression for CI testing"
  git push origin test-ci-regression
  ```

  **Step 3: Create pull request**
  - Navigate to: https://github.com/[username]/VC_Scripter/pulls
  - Click "New pull request"
  - Base: main, Compare: test-ci-regression
  - Click "Create pull request"

  **Step 4: Verify CI workflow and status checks**
  On the PR page, verify:
  1. "Decompilation Validation" workflow starts automatically
  2. Status check shows "Some checks haven't completed yet" while running
  3. After completion, status check shows failure (red X) due to baseline mismatch
  4. "Merge pull request" button is DISABLED (greyed out) with message "Merging is blocked"
  5. Message states: "Required status check 'validate' has not succeeded"

  **Step 5: Verify regression detection in test output**
  Click "Details" next to failed status check:
  - Should see pytest failure with baseline mismatch
  - Error shows expected vs actual values (error_count: 0 vs 999)

  **Step 6: Clean up test branch**
  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git branch -D test-ci-regression
  git push origin --delete test-ci-regression
  ```
  Close the PR without merging.

  Expected state:
  - Workflow runs on PR automatically
  - Failed validation blocks merge
  - Baseline regression is detected and reported
  - Branch protection prevents merging broken code
