	\n
	Situation:\n
	\t Upon evaluating all the information and data supplied by intelligence, command has issued an order to build a new camp designed to train the Montagnards for the CIDG project in the Nui Pek area. The primary mission objective is to contact the Jarai tribe mountaineers in the nearby village and persuade them to cooperate. At the same time, the team should try to determine the strength of the enemy in the area. It is assumed that at least one branch of the Ho-Chi-Minh trail from Cambodia to this part of Vietnam leads through the area. The scanty information obtained by the LLBD’s reconnaissance shows there is relatively weak guerilla unit activity, who also seem to steer clear of the local residents as the locals are hostile towards them. Upon establishing contact with the villagers, the team surveys the area and transfers to the landing zone and waits for the chopper.\n
	\n
	Course of action: \n
	\t The team lead by SFC Douglas will be dropped off at 0855 and 0900 in the “Michigan” landing zone, coordinates Alpha – Tango – Charlie, 500 meters southeast of the village. Following the reconnaissance and scouting for possible traces of the enemy, the team will transfer to the village where they will try to accomplish the primary mission objective. If they run into the enemy, they should kill them and possibly collect intelligence information.\n

	\n
	Call sign: “Hammer 1” and “Hammer 2”.\n
	\n
	Situation: \n
	\t Intelligence has informed the A-216 commander about the existence of a VC underground factory manufacturing ammunition and explosives for enemy guerilla units operating in the area. According to intelligence the NVA across the border are facing serious problems in their supply chain and are on the verge of total disintegration, as the American air force intensively attacks their supply convoys on the Ho-Chi-Minh trail. Thus, the NVA have been unable to supply ammunition to their VC units. For that reason, the North has transferred several specialists from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to this area who have launched the production of ammunition and explosives from stolen materials. Intelligence indicates a successful strike against this factory could seriously disrupt and possibly, completely paralyze (if only temporarily) the guerilla’s ability to conduct massive offensive activities in the area. However, the South Vietnamese reconnaissance information is rather sketchy, incomplete and inaccurate, so the strike will be conducted with a certain amount of risk.\n
	\n
	Course of action:\n
	\t The mission must be precisely timed. An F-4 (call sign “Buffalo 2” will attack the target area at 1900. At 1905 sharp, three UH-1s will appear above the area carrying an assault group. In one pass the gunners on board will try to kill as many surviving guerilla troops as possible who are defending the building where the North Vietnamese experts are located.\n
	\t The drop will take place immediately after. Speed will be critical. Only Hammer 1 will go into the building itself. The remaining Hammer 2 members will secure the path to the landing zone, the area surrounding the building and keep guerilla reinforcements at bay with gunfire. The assault team will thus gain the time required for successful task completion. The most important task is to kill the North Vietnamese experts, destroy the manufacturing machines and put the factory out of operation, rendering it irreparable. As soon as the primary mission objectives are completed, the entire unit must be rapidly evacuated as fierce enemy retaliation is expected.\n

\t A-263 (“Fist Sigma”), A-278 (“Fist Omega”) and 115th CIDG company (“Fist Gamma”).\n
	\n
	Situation: \n
#53211: 	#ame \t When interrogating the guerillas captured during the assault on Nui Pek on May 9, the LLDB intelligence officers learned the precise location of the extensive camp complex serving as the base for the units of the 32nd regiment of the 1st NVA division in Cambodia. In addition, this regiment provides logistic and military support to the guerillas on the other side of the border, where the A-216 team operates. A battery of M-46 130 mm field cannons, is located in this camp which the North Vietnamese employ for shelling targets on the South Vietnamese side of the border. \n
	\t It was thus decided to carry out a top secret mission called “Fist Alpha” and attack this battery, render it non-functional, destroy the regiment’s fuel supplies used for supply vehicles, try to kill any high-ranking officers from the regiment’s command and obtain intelligence information and documents.\n
	\t Teams A-253 and A-278 will attack different targets in the same complex within this operation and the 115th CIDG platoon in conjunction with USAF aircraft will launch diversionary attacks before the mission begins on less important targets. The final task, once the above primary tasks have been completed, is to guide the USAF aircraft to the entire complex so it can be bombed.\n
	\n
	Course of action: \n
	\t Individual teams will be dropped by choppers several kilometers from their targets at 1530. The drop off will be synchronized with the commencement of diversionary USAF aircraft action. They will take off from bases in Thailand and bomb less important targets in and around the base complex. Simultaneously, the 115th CIDG platoon will attack the complex from the opposite (north) side. The combination of these actions should divert the North Vietnamese’s attention from the primary targets.\n
	\t Team A-216, entrusted with the most difficult task, must destroy the M-46 cannon battery. Only its approximate location is known, as it is thoroughly camouflaged and air reconnaissance has not yet been able to detect it and confirm its presence. We presume, that whole area around cannon battery is heavily guarded and has its own radio station Team must first eliminate the guards and destroy the radio, to prevent NVA regimental command being alarmed. Then the actual destruction of the field guns may begin \n
#53212: 	#ame 
\t. Afterwards, the team will focus on the 32nd regimental command center. This is located approximately one klick from the battery position. Primary target are obviously the guards around the base. We can presume, that their concentration will be partly disrupted by cover actions of Gamma and USAF. After elimination of guards the team will secure the base surroundings and SFC Douglas will infiltrate inside the complex, directly to the regimental command center. Here if possible, he will kill any high ranking officers, especially the regimental commander, colonel Lu Van Hao. Needed is also retrieval of any strategically important documents. \n
\t Then SFC Douglas will destroy the fuel supplies the North Vietnamese desperately need. Next, they will guide the bombers in and quickly evacuate. Radio navigation of B-52 bombers will be done by team Sigma.\n

The Thunderchief crashed several hundred meters away in the jungle.\n
	\t The team immediately began searching for the pilot and radioed captain Rosenfield to call off the USAF’s rescue operation, as they were in the area and would carry out the search. They also requested airlift by chopper, should there be a need to quickly evacuate.\n
	\t Pilot, lieutenant Francis Bradley, was found unconscious, but only with mild injuries. The team ran into a small VC unit operating in that area. The enemy immediately came to the crash area, in attempt to capture the pilot and acquire materials from the wreckage. After the pilot was found and treated initially, the team made for the landing zone under constant fire. The chopper extracted them.\n

	\t The A-216 team lead by SFC Douglas’ task was to explore the Jarai village and establish friendly contact with the tribe in order to convince them to join the CIDG project and guard the border areas.\n
	\t After they were dropped off near the village and met with the elders, their negotiations were suddenly disrupted by a local guard reporting several guerillas units approaching.\n
	\t The team immediately took up positions in front of the village as SFC. Douglas was worried about casualties among villagers, should the battle take place in the middle of the Montagnard village. Following a short fire-fight, the team killed the guerillas who probably came to steal food from the villagers.\n
	\t This event broke the ice and the villagers promised help and support especially after Sgt. Douglas let them keep the guns from the dead communists. One of the villagers who spoke broken English, said he could take the team to a place which is used by the VC. Thus they found an unexpected target – a secret guerilla hanging bridge over a gorge. Its importance was clear from the fact it was guarded by machine gun post. After these were destroyed, sapper Bronson blew up the bridge using the C-4 explosives and the team transferred to landing zone “Echo Zulu”, from which they were airlifted.\n

	\t The A-216 team’s task was to destroy the ammunition factory supplying the local VC units which were located by South Vietnamese reconnaissance in the underground area under the Buddhist temple near the deserted Ai Tu village.\n
	\t Just before they were dropped off, a USAF F-4 Phantom II attacked the target area. Afterwards, the A-216 team accompanied by several mountaineers from CIDG, were dropped off by three UH-1. They encountered relatively strong resistance from the enemy on the ground. Despite that, the selected men were able to get into the temple and underground spaces where they successfully completed their tasks. The North Vietnamese experts were killed and sapper Bronson placed C-4 explosive throughout the entire structure whose detonation was set to 1955. In the meantime, the cover team on the surface kept the enemy at a distance with constant fire. Afterwards, the entire team was evacuated under heavy fire.\n
	\t The explosives detonated at 1955 sharp, right before the evacuation choppers left the area. A strong explosion was seen followed by a chain of smaller secondary explosions. The building was completely destroyed.\n

	\n
	\t The VC attacked the Nui Pek base under construction on May 9 at 0500, possibly in retaliation for their ammunition factory which was destroyed and as a reaction to the strong presence of SF in the area. Since the unit was notified beforehand about a possible attack, and command took this warning seriously, the defense of the base was quickly intensified by newly built machinegun posts and barricades.\n
	\t Following the initial intense enemy attack, the unit managed to slow the enemy down and eventually stop him. The enemy responded with mortar-fire which were destroyed by the brave action of SFC Douglas and SFC Bronson. After this successful counter attack, the enemy was completely weakened and the attack on Nui Pek was ended at: 1000 as stated in the report to Plei Ku.\n
	\t During the cleaning operations there was a strong explosion nearby the base. It was probably a howitzer shell, luckily it didn't hit the base and there was no further damage from the explosion, but it is only matter of time till the howitzer battery hidden probably in the jungle at the border with Cambodia improves it's aim and destroys the SF camp. Finding and elimination of this howitzer battery is now mission of maximal priority. Survival of the Nui Pek camp depends on it.

Upon quietly approaching and destroying the anti-aircraft gun post, the team members shot the cannon operators and using the C-4 explosives, blew up the cannons. After destroying the battery, the team made their way to the command of the 32nd NVA regiment, about 5 kilometers away, where their fuel storage was located. Under cover, the team killed the machine gunners in their posts and then attacked the anti-aircraft gun posts killing several officers and placed C-4 explosives. Afterwards, the team members retreated to landing zone “Alligator” from which they were airlifted by two UH-1s. \n

The EF-105F version of the two-seater Thunderchief proved to be efficient during the dangerous “Wild Weasel” missions, where their crews over North Vietnam would detect SAM anti-aircraft missile batteries and attract their fire, ahead of bomber or fighter raids.\n
	This large, all-weather fighter aircraft was originally designed as a one-seater and was able to bomb with conventional bombs as well as attack with tactical nuclear weapons. In addition, it was efficient in traditional dog-fights with enemy fighter jets. For this reason it was equipped with the M-61 A1 20 mm cannon. It can be said it met all the requirements but it was relatively vulnerable to anti-aircraft machine gun fire.\n

#53291: 	#ame One of the most widely used universal fighter helicopters. This two-rotary monster won recognition and admiration due for its multi-purpose use. The American Army received the first Chinooks in the late 1962. Supposedly their first mission was the battle in the Ia Drang valley near the Cambodian border, which the Americans fought in the fall of 1965. In Vietnam, the Chinooks served to transport large ally units, heavy loads and was additionally armed with machine guns and cannons similar to a “gunship”.\n

#53301: 	#ame Bell’s Iroquois versions B, C, D and H is one-engine, versatile helicopter with a traditional design utilizing a two-blade supporting and stabilizing rotor. It was designed to be a maneuverable craft for the transportation of personnel as well as material to front lines. The quality of this chopper is attested to by the fact that various versions of it are still used by numerous countries all over the world. The US Army used it for transportation, evacuation, rescue, the transfer of injured soldiers, as well as an attack aircraft. In addition, it was used as a supply aircraft equipped with spray bars for spraying defoliants and proved to be useful in transporting special units as well as CIA agents. It’s impossible to say how many soldiers the UH-1 has transported into missions, how many injured soldiers it saved or how many dead soldiers flew on board. This machine, more than anything else, is a symbol of the Vietnam war. Its very well known factory name – Iroquois – has been almost forgotten, as the public know it by only one name, “Huey”.\n

	Soviet industry however, was not able to copy the American original with the necessary precision or use quality materials, thus the copy, type 67, was indeed no match for its original. In reality, the GAZ was highly defective. Its only advantage is that it has a simple to drive unit with undemanding requirements for fuel quality.\n

	One of the most feared weapons used by the infantry. This has been one of the most successful guns and it’s hard to believe that it was introduced some 40 years ago. The American soldiers like it for its reliability, range and devastating effect on its target. Various modifications of this weapon are used as positional weapons on tripods or in gun-carriages mounted on military vehicles or as anti-aircraft missiles. The firing ability of this air-cooled machine gun is so versatile that it can be used not only against enemy infantry targets far away, efficiently ruling out the danger from return fire, but when specialized ammunition is utilized, light fortifications, buildings or even military vehicles can be destroyed.\n

	This Soviet, air-cooled heavy machine gun, used as an anti-artillery weapon, was employed by the Soviet Red Army, their satellites, as well as the Chinese Communist Army. It is a massive and efficient weapon, unpopular with some guerilla groups due to its weight, which significantly restricts mobility. Despite that it is a dangerous defensive weapon, highly efficient and deadly.\n

	An automatic weapon whose construction was based on the successful M-1 Garand. In the 50’s the US Army refused to follow international trends in the assault weapon industry, which were turning toward the development of light weapons utilizing smaller caliber bullets. Even though the M-14 is a very precise, top-quality, sturdy weapon with automatic and semi-automatic firing capabilities, it will be soon replaced by new weapon. In Vietnam, it is used by snipers but those were specially picked top-quality models, the most accurate ones equipped with optics.\n

	The 61 Scorpion machine gun was developed and manufactured in Czechoslovakia for tank crews, police and the needs of special units. When using 7.65 caliber ammo, the narrow breech was not able to absorb the recoil, therefore counterweights were added to reduce it. Despite this modification, the weapon was virtually impossible to target accurately with while firing continuously. It is still popular all over the world, unfortunately and especially with various terrorist groups because of its small size. It is said Ho-Chi-Min’s bodyguards were armed with these weapons.\n

	     Rate of fire:……………..550 rpm (450 rpm with silencer)\n
	     Magazine capacity:….32 rounds\n
	     This submachine gun was designed as a cheap, durable and easy to manufacture gun by British designers Sheppard and Turpin during the World War II in Enfield armory (this is the reason for the name 'Sten'). Price of the gun was incredibly low, only 2.5 pounds, so the gun was manufactured in big numbers. It was used by paratroopers and vehicle crews. Also many guerilla fighters from the western Europe used this gun for it's durability.\n
	     Although the Sten is very durable gun, capable of working in both cold and dirty conditions, it has one big disadvantage - it's magazine and feeding system, since those were prone to failures to feed. It is not recommended to hold the gun by the magazine, since it could cause the jamming of the gun easily.\n
	     The Sten is used in Vietnam mainly by Australian advisors, Green Beret and Seal, especially the version with a silencer.\n

#53530: 	#ame M-18 Claymore mine\n
#53531: 	#ame “Directional mine”. When detonated, the explosion hurls a shower of steel fragments to a distance of 250 meters with a 60 degree dispersion rate. The mine is composed of a plastic casing and a curved panel of explosive, on which hundreds of projectiles are arranged and fused in plastic. It can also be used as an automatic explosive or be detonated remotely. It was a very efficient weapon in Vietnam.\n
	
#53540: 	#ame Montagnard’s weapons \n
#53541: 	#ame The mountaineer tribes along the Vietnamese and Cambodian border were equipped with both traditional weapons, as well as weapons supplied by the American Green Berets. Their traditional armament mainly included bow and arrows, hand-made knifes and machetes of all shapes, as well as primitive firearms. These comprised home-made, single-action matchlock pistols. It may seem these weapons are not too dangerous, but many a Vietcong who crossed over to their area had the chance to witness the mountaineers operate these matchlock pistols or bow and arrows with great precision, often repelling their Kalashnikov-armed units. \n
	Numerous guerilla fighters and North Vietnamese didn’t survive such encounters with the locals. Occasionally, these mountaineers were also equipped with confiscated enemy weapons, guns used by the French colonial army, hunting guns, weapons they stole from the Japanese and now the communists. The Montagnards incorporated into the CIDG project were armed with American weapons. The M-1 carbine seemed to be the most suitable weapon for them.\n
	
	
#53550: 	#ame Vietcong traps \n
#53551: 	#ame The allies in South Vietnam would often run into “falling holes”. These were the most primitive but also feared traps. Sharp bamboo poles, often contaminated with excrements, were stuck into the bottom of the trap. The trap itself was usually covered with a mat and camouflaged with vegetation. Bamboo easily penetrated the soles of military boots and caused terrible injuries. These were seldom deadly, however the psychological impact of such an injury was great as soldiers watched their friends double up in pain.\n
	Other, more dangerous types of traps were the numerous forms of “hedgehogs” hooked to various mechanisms which upon being activated by an enemy soldier walking on them, would literally throw and nail his body down. It is very sad that the Vietcong often commissioned women and children to produce these inhumane weapons.\n
	Very frequently, traps utilizing ammunition were used. Unlike the NVA, the Vietcong seldom possessed special anti-artillery mines, thus they had to improvise. Also armed grenades in cans or mines made out of artillery mortars of various calibers could be found. Artillery mortars were usually placed upright in holes. A metal point was positioned under a match and a small board was placed on the grenade camouflaged with leaves. If a soldier stepped on this mechanism, the pressure of his foot pushed it down, the point lit the match and an explosion occurred.\n

#293: 	#ame One team attacks, while the other defends. The attackers must capture a number of flags in order, while the defenders must stop them for as long as they can. The flags also act as re-spawn points for the attacking team, so it is essential that the defending team stop the attackers from getting a foothold. Once the last flag has been turned, the defenders will become attackers. After the two rounds, the team who took the least amount of time to turn all the flags takes the point.
