#4170: 	#ame You see that heavy gun in the bunker?
#4172: 	#ame No chance, man - he’s well dug in.

#4928: 	#ame Not a moment too soon man!
#5450: 	#ame Sure, take what you want.
#5451: 	#ame Take this, I got plenty.
#5452: 	#ame Try to aim and you won’t need so much.
#5453: 	#ame Empty already?
#5454: 	#ame Good, more you shoot, less I carry.
#5455: 	#ame More ammo? Here you are.
#5456: 	#ame Here, grab this.
#5457: 	#ame More ammo? Don’t waste it man.
#6535: 	#ame Damn it, what’s the matter with this stinking carburetor?
#6536: 	#ame Come on! What’s your problem, bullshit machine?
#6537: 	#ame Work, you piece of crap!
#6538: 	#ame Hey there, I’m Bronson. A demolition specialist for the team, you must be the new guy?
#6540: 	#ame I’m trying to fix up old faithful - this jeep puts in some serious mileage, out in the boonies, that's why it's screwed, and why I've gotta nurse it back to health.
#6541: 	#ame There must be a way to repair it, what am I doing wrong?
#6542: 	#ame Have you spoken to the Captain yet?
#6543: 	#ame Have you met the Captain?
#6544: 	#ame The Captain’s waiting for you in the TOC bunker. 
#6545: 	#ame Hey Hawkins. How’s it goin’?
#6546: 	#ame I need to finish with the engine now.
#6547: 	#ame I’m busy right now.
#8577: 	#ame Bullshit Hornster, you never had a tank!
#8579: 	#ame Horseshit!
#8597: 	#ame No more Hornster either...
#8637: 	#ame Chill out, bro. These assholes are cornered. If they don't surrender, it’s gonna be one hell of a fight!
#8660: 	#ame Could be worse.
#8662: 	#ame Dunno, maybe if they sent some tanks up and at us... Better get our shit ready. Come on.
#8715: 	#ame But what a way to go! Ka-boom! Too bad you didn’t let me blow it later, Captain, when there would be more gooks up there!
#8723: 	#ame Yep, but most of the activity is round here, right?
#1613: 	#ame Fire! Burns! Help! Bac si!
#1628: 	#ame We protecting warehouse! VC here, but we kill!
#1630: 	#ame This part clear, no VC here!

#1732: 	#ame Hold them off!
#1752: 	#ame They cross moat on bridge. Kill them!
#1753: 	#ame We be dead if we not destroy da bridge!
#1790: 	#ame They here, we run!
#531: 	#ame We must take him back to his village.
#556: 	#ame Shit! Here they come!
#602: 	#ame Yeah, I guess!
#611: 	#ame ...or Charlie finds us!
#637: 	#ame Hey D, how does he spot those freakin' traps?
#644: 	#ame  Trip one of those toe-poppers, and you'll be going home without your foot, or your nuts! 
#648: 	#ame Spooky, ain't it?
#666: 	#ame Shit, there's a bunch of 'em.
#679: 	#ame Another trap! 
#684: 	#ame No problem Red Bird. 
#699: 	#ame -
#723: 	#ame Where we going, Top?
#804: 	#ame Yo - we’re gotta clear the rest of the area.
#1410: 	#ame Shit, this guy's still alive!
#1446: 	#ame He's dead man... Nothin' we could do...
#1484: 	#ame Take it easy, pal. We gonna get you outta here ASAP. Within a week, you gonna be back in the world sippin' cold beers, you just gotta try and stay awake, buddy.
#1612: 	#ame Go go go! 
#1614: 	#ame Hold on, I'm coming!
#3003: 	#ame Nothing I can do for those guys...
#3005: 	#ame Lets get the hell outta here - you can bet Charlie saw us goin’ down!
#3050: 	#ame Incoming!
#3107: 	#ame Jesus, the friggin‘ mosquitoes! They drive me crazy!
#3164: 	#ame Thank Christ that’s over, Top!
#3307: 	#ame Hopefully his head will have broke his fall! We’re gonna have to wait for them.
#3313: 	#ame Ok, I’ll sit on my ass here. I hope Bronson fixes things as good as he breaks ‘em apart.
#3314: 	#ame You should call the Captain.
#3337: 	#ame They'll be here any minute! When I heard the shots, I told 'em to hurry the fuck up. I’ll take position over there!
#3338: 	#ame I don’t like this tunnel entrance. I’ll cover it from here and make sure no one comes out!
#3420: 	#ame Shit.
#3502: 	#ame Yes, sir.
#3515: 	#ame Yes, sir. Definitely a bit better than a bullet in your head. 
#3518: 	#ame Captain, I’m gonna take a look at my patients.
#3531: 	#ame Fuck me! Take cover!
#3536: 	#ame Ok, Captain.
#3537: 	#ame Make sure you are hidden behind cover at all times.
#3538: 	#ame And move only when the Captain provides covering fire.
#3546: 	#ame Quick, let's move up to the paddy-fields. Stay with me!
#3547: 	#ame Shit, we can’t get to them from here. 
#3549: 	#ame We can try it, but don't mind crawling.
#3550: 	#ame I will cover you from here.
#3551: 	#ame You go on, and try to outflank them.
#3553: 	#ame Shell cases and blood. Bastards slipped away!
#3555: 	#ame Don’t be too eager man, you’ll have plenty of other chances, believe me!
#3557: 	#ame Ok, Hawkins. But be careful.
#3559: 	#ame Let's see what you can do!
#3560: 	#ame Nice shooting, Hawkins.
#3561: 	#ame I thought I heard you say you could handle yourself?
#3562: 	#ame They’ve di di’d man, back to their tunnels.
#3563: 	#ame It’s too risky to follow them into the jungle. Let's go get that rice wine, man!
#3575: 	#ame Let’s get back to the village.
#3580: 	#ame Hello again guys 'n' gals. Number one Bac-si is back with more medicine, hope you like needles!
#3581: 	#ame  Right! Which of you lucky chaps didn't get inoculated last time? La dai, la dai it only hurts a little bit!
#3595: 	#ame Slow down a bit my friends, cham! I can't understand you, khong biet! Just don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. No dau! No dau!
#3613: 	#ame Yes sir.
#3614: 	#ame It’s just a scratch. Nothing serious.
#3620: 	#ame Go go go.
#3621: 	#ame Forward!
#3622: 	#ame Let’s move!
#3623: 	#ame Watch out! Take cover!
#3624: 	#ame Down!
#3625: 	#ame Heads down!
#3814: 	#ame There is a whole VC platoon attacking the hill. 
#3819: 	#ame You gotta take out those mortars, Top.
#3823: 	#ame Those mortars are gonna really paste the relay site!
#3827: 	#ame Hawkins, you gotta get those mortars, or there ain't gonna be a station to rescue!
#3834: 	#ame How are you guys?
#3848: 	#ame Shut up, Hornster.
#3920: 	#ame VC, north wire fifty meters!
#3921: 	#ame VC to the north, fifty meters!
#3922: 	#ame VC incoming, fifty meters!
#3923: 	#ame North side VC, fifty meters.
#3924: 	#ame Gooks comin' in. Fifty meters.
#3925: 	#ame VC over there - fifty meters.
#3926: 	#ame VC north side, twenty meters!
#3927: 	#ame VC on the north side. Twenty meters!
#3928: 	#ame VC attacking north side, twenty meters!
#3929: 	#ame Shit, they're coming close, twenty meters.
#3930: 	#ame VC comin' up the north side. Twenty meters.
#3931: 	#ame VC other there, look! Twenty meters.

#3936: 	#ame North side fifteen meters.
#3937: 	#ame VC near my pos. Fifteen meters.
#3938: 	#ame Shit, they're on the north side of the hill!
#3939: 	#ame VC north side of the hill!
#4007: 	#ame Here we go again, hombres - another stroll in the park!
#4027: 	#ame Ohh, hear that Hornster, you’d better shut up or Bronson's gonna...
#4056: 	#ame They‘re all over the freakin' place, worse than damn cockroaches!
#4074: 	#ame What now Top? We can't get through that... Hey, Nhut! You lost?
#4106: 	#ame We’re late. The other teams are probably half way up the hill by now.
#4122: 	#ame He’s dead.
#4130: 	#ame Jesus fucking Christ, what a slaughter.
#4135: 	#ame Over there - somebody is still alive.
#4143: 	#ame They’re all wounded.
#4144: 	#ame They're stabilized. Now all they need is a medevac.
#4175: 	#ame The wounded need medevac ASAP!
#4340: 	#ame The gooks would shoot Marv the second they thought we were coming for him.
#4360: 	#ame Be careful Top. If they spring us, Marv's a dead man.
#4503: 	#ame I am the only doctor within a fifty mile radius.
#4510: 	#ame Park somewhere nearby, Hawkins...
#4517: 	#ame But what about the Montagnard guy? 
#4534: 	#ame Be careful, Top. The road is number ten. And we ain't gonna be much help, if we end up wrapped around a tree!
#4556: 	#ame Careful Top. There are soldiers on the bridge.
#4562: 	#ame Poor bastards. I wouldn't like to stand around on that bridge all night.
#4565: 	#ame Put your foot down Top!
#4566: 	#ame Step on the gas!
#4567: 	#ame Careful Top, we gotta get there in one piece!
#4606: 	#ame Get your rifle firing for Christ sakes, Hawkins!
#4660: 	#ame Fuck me! They’re bugging out! Someone take 'em!
#4704: 	#ame Ambush!
#4706: 	#ame Sounds like we got here just in time!
#4715: 	#ame Let's give these bastards a little surprise!
#4728: 	#ame Your favourite beverage, Hawkins!
#4734: 	#ame I wonder what suckers will volunteer for that?
#4807: 	#ame You can scratch 'em on some punji then! 
#4813: 	#ame Be careful of the freakin’ traps!
#4824: 	#ame That's no way to die.
#4844: 	#ame Jesus, I’ve seen enough stiffs to last a freakin‘ lifetime!
#4882: 	#ame There’s one alive!
#4884: 	#ame He’s dead!
#4891: 	#ame We can’t wait here for them to overrun us!
#4907: 	#ame Freakin fly-boys! A few clouds and they get to sit back smokin‘ doobies!
#5440: 	#ame Wait a moment, I’ll patch you up.
#5441: 	#ame It’s going to be ok, just wait a moment.
#5442: 	#ame Just a flesh wound. I’ll bandage it.
#5443: 	#ame Don’t move, I gotta bandage this wound.
#5444: 	#ame You’ll survive. 
#5445: 	#ame Nothing serious... here you go.
#5446: 	#ame You’re bleeding, wait a moment.
#5447: 	#ame Show me the wound.
#5448: 	#ame You’ll be good as new.
#5449: 	#ame Time for your medicine, man.
#6549: 	#ame Come on Ong, you’ll be fine, try to breath nice'n'easy.
#6550: 	#ame Don’t worry, you ain't gonna die. You're going be medevacced to a nice comfy hospital, with loads of hot virgin nurses, pretty soon you'll be number one!
#6554: 	#ame Hi there, I’m Crocker, Joe Crocker.
#6556: 	#ame Pleased to meet you Hawkins, it's a shame there ain't more of you; we lost three men during the last assault!
#6558: 	#ame VC attacked the base a week ago, first with mortars, and then an assault on the west wire. They nearly broke through!
#6559: 	#ame Yes sir.
#6560: 	#ame Captain wanted to talk to you.
#6561: 	#ame Has the Captain said hello yet?
#6562: 	#ame Hi Hawkins.
#6563: 	#ame Sorry, I’m busy at the moment.
#6564: 	#ame Sorry, I gotta take care of this trooper right now.
#6599: 	#ame Come with me to see the Captain.
#6603: 	#ame I’m Joe Crocker, the medic of the team.
#6604: 	#ame We have to inoculate kids in a nearby Montagnard village. We’re also gonna take some rice for them.
#6616: 	#ame This CIDG troop stuck his foot in his boot this morning, and found a poison spider the hard way! ...so I’m doseing him up with an antivenin.
#6617: 	#ame Don’t panic, it doesn’t happen too often. Just make sure you check your boots before you put them on, OK?
#6649: 	#ame Hi, you must be the new guy, Hawkins. I'm Joe Crocker. I'm sorry, but I gotta go to the Captain. Later, man.
#8586: 	#ame Extra work for me, I guess...
#8635: 	#ame You noticed too, huh? I bet ya he suckled blood instead of milk!
#8639: 	#ame There is a sick local down in the village, he's having some problems. They just called us on their radio. I‘ve gotta get down there!
#8641: 	#ame It’s not night anymore, it’s almost four A.M. Captain wants you and Defort to escort me. Nhut will come with us too... Come on then, get moving! We’re leaving now!
#8651: 	#ame I usually disagree with Mr. Bullethead here, but this time he's right. 
#8699: 	#ame So VC are harassing the 'yards again?
#8721: 	#ame What about our wounded? We have more than we can cope with, that's not including the walking wounded! Like this asshole here, who should be in hospital!
#8726: 	#ame And you’ll be worm food tomorrow.
#8741: 	#ame Your lucky that punji wasn't poisoned... You wouldn't be here now!
#518: 	#ame Roger Six, make it quick. Out.
#568: 	#ame Roger.
#586: 	#ame Fuck! I’ll call for assistance!
#587: 	#ame Six, this is One, large VC group attacking the village, send assistance ASAP! Over.
#591: 	#ame The egg beater's here!
#605: 	#ame I dunno man, I'm just glad he's up on point! 
#609: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Spike One. Insertion OK. We're entering the jungle and heading to the northeast, over.
#617: 	#ame You kidding! We're in deep, hostile jungle, dodging VC, tiptoeing past traps and toe-poppers, I feel great! 
#618: 	#ame Stop the chatter Defort, you just worry about that horn!
#647: 	#ame You hear some weird noises humpin' the boonies.
#649: 	#ame I prefer listening to the wildlife, then the sound of a VC clicking his AK on to full auto!
#654: 	#ame Hotel Six freq is set up, Sarge!
#667: 	#ame Do we zap 'em now?
#680: 	#ame Charlie must be hidin' somethin' big around here...
#686: 	#ame Hawkins, get down! 
#698: 	#ame -
#700: 	#ame -
#722: 	#ame Who gives a shit, man? This is eating in to my R'n'R time!
#805: 	#ame Right, let's mop up these gooks. Hope you left plenty for me!
#1422: 	#ame Top. Dustoff is on the horn.
#1707: 	#ame Six, this is Eye One. Roger, out.
#1920: 	#ame And that fucking big tank?
#3001: 	#ame You alright, Sarge?
#3010: 	#ame Let’s move up there. Radio will probably read better. 
#3021: 	#ame Hotel Six is up, but he's breaking up and is not readable, Top.
#3028: 	#ame It's a bit sketchy 'cause we are down in the valley, Top. We just have to keep trying. 
#3038: 	#ame Nasty sons of bitches! 
#3052: 	#ame Heads up! Bunker!
#3055: 	#ame Shut the fuck up, Hornster, you think I didn’t think of that already?
#3058: 	#ame Damn, he’s getting away!
#3060: 	#ame I’m trying to raise the FAC on the fire control frequency, but no joy so far, Top.
#3067: 	#ame Yeah, It looked hot from the air!
#3075: 	#ame OK, Sarge. We got a connection.
#3153: 	#ame I dunno man, they should've been in a blocking position up to the north...
#3156: 	#ame Yep, that's the way it goes, CJ...
#3166: 	#ame I need a cigarette...
#3305: 	#ame The ladder broke on Hornster half way up.
#3308: 	#ame Nah, Bronson can fix the ladder!
#3310: 	#ame Should be online.
#3312: 	#ame Right behind ya, like a shadow.
#3315: 	#ame  I got a connection, it’s the Captain.
#3325: 	#ame Check that gook out, he ain't seen us.
#3326: 	#ame Shit, over there!
#3334: 	#ame This seems like a perfect place! I’m gonna camp right here!
#3335: 	#ame This is a good spot. Any fucker shows his head and bang, it’s gone. 
#3375: 	#ame Here you are.
#3506: 	#ame Roger, Six. Bronson's here, he heard you. Should be there in ten. Over.

#3705: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Shrew One. Insertion OK. We reached checkpoint Blue, ready for crossing, over.
#3727: 	#ame They're gonna love this back at camp. We were scared shitless by a pile of scrap!
#3789: 	#ame Shit, I hope they don't fire up these tanks we're lookin' for!
#3804: 	#ame Vista Alpha, this is Vista Bravo, do you hear me? Over.
#3806: 	#ame Vista Alpha, this is Vista Bravo. Don’t worry, we are already approaching. Over.
#3808: 	#ame Vista Alpha, this is Vista Bravo. We'll fly around the hill and clear the area from the air. Over.
#3810: 	#ame Vista Alpha, this is Vista Bravo. What’s going on? Do you copy? Over.
#3812: 	#ame Shit, he's been hit! Something bad has happened.
#3856: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Vista Bravo. We have arrived at relay station, switching positions with Vista Alpha. Enemy seem to have been pushed back. Over.

#4037: 	#ame Looks like we were expected here, sir.
#4057: 	#ame  I’d rather be fighting ‘roaches! Least they ain't got AKs!

#4529: 	#ame Mountain Eagle, this is Fox One. We hear you and are headed your way. Should be there in a few minutes. Over.

#4710: 	#ame Shit - they’ve got back up!
#4716: 	#ame They’re not gonna expect us to come rollin‘ round the corner!
#4724: 	#ame Those guys owe us a beer! 
#4727: 	#ame Here they come! Over to the east!
#4735: 	#ame You’ve got one guess!
#4736: 	#ame They're bugging out!
#4809: 	#ame Yeah, I’d like to see that!
#4814: 	#ame Trip over one of those suckers, and you can kiss your foot goodbye!
#4831: 	#ame Must’ve left in a hurry then...
#4871: 	#ame Damn it!
#4892: 	#ame We need to get 'round the back of 'em!
#4905: 	#ame Damn it!
#4908: 	#ame Yeah, while we get to dodge goddamn shell splinters.

#5504: 	#ame The horn’s yours.
#6509: 	#ame Hey man, good old CJ is back - good to see you! Who’s the FNG?
#6511: 	#ame Yo! I’m Defort, the radio operator. The captain wants to talk to you. He should be in the TOC bunker. It’s the one with the American flag flying.
#6514: 	#ame So, CJ, how was Saigon? Up to your usual tricks?
#6516: 	#ame I know that anything's possible where you're involved, CJ. Come on then, what happened?
#6518: 	#ame ...I remember only too well, and then what happened?
#6520: 	#ame No way! Come on then, spill the beans. You didn't... ...did you?
#6522: 	#ame And that real man was you! Ha ha ha... So you showed her some special moves, right?
#6524: 	#ame You could try! But you better see Doc first, ‘cause you probably brought something back with you! Forget women though, man! We gotta get outta this shithole first! Unless you want to teach me how to romance the water buffalo...
#6526: 	#ame They’re getting much better. They’ve been working out steady on the range all week, and they're doing OK!
#6530: 	#ame Captain Rosenfield wants to talk to you.
#6531: 	#ame Hawkins, report to the Captain.
#6532: 	#ame Sorry, I gotta go set up a PRC 25 and a couple of HT-1’s for the patrols tomorrow.
#6533: 	#ame A soldier's work is never done. I'll be ready soon.
#6534: 	#ame I got stuff to do man, I'll catch you later.
#6669: 	#ame What the fuck was that!
#6672: 	#ame Argh!
#8580: 	#ame Those tanks'll smash you into a million tiny Hornsters. 
#8585: 	#ame More excitement than we care for, except Mr Horny here!
#8602: 	#ame Oh yeah? And why not you, big guy? Too fat, huh?
#8632: 	#ame Listen, buddy, you've had a very unhappy childhood, haven't you?
#8634: 	#ame You’re bloodthirsty like some kinda fucked-up M-60 wielding vampire.
#8644: 	#ame Who wouldn’t?
#8658: 	#ame I'm regretting it all the time.
#8681: 	#ame Cool. Can I have one?
#8687: 	#ame Didn't hit 'em hard enough...

#202: 	#ame Hawkins, you're dead! Raise your hands and come back here!
#203: 	#ame You stupid fucker, you're dead now! 
#204: 	#ame Fuck! I was hoping you'd last at least ten seconds, you stupid moron!
#205: 	#ame Fucking idiot! Hawkins, looks like you are up for more latrine duties!
#206: 	#ame Jesus H Christ! That shithead did it again. Let himself get killed! HAWKINS!!! I'll tear you apart, you dog!
#207: 	#ame Goddamn moron! Throw down your weapon and raise your hands!
#208: 	#ame IDIOT! Stay in cover, you penis!
#209: 	#ame You're wearing a blue helmet, but you'd look better in a clowns hat. You're a goddamn disgrace!
#213: 	#ame Another day, another corpse... You'll die this evening during our little fun-run, I swear!
#214: 	#ame Hawkins, your team mates are dying! Do something about it!
#215: 	#ame Move it, fuckers! Don't worry about those assholes, just shoot 'em!
#216: 	#ame Hawkins, stop hiding away like a goddamn shirt-lifter. Move! Kill them!
#217: 	#ame Attack, pussies! Those wax bullets won't kill you! I will though, if you do not start doing something!
#218: 	#ame That flag is waiting for you, Hawkins! So why the fuck are you not there already?
#219: 	#ame Don't fuck with me, you lazy bastards, or I'll get my own God damn gun and jump in there with you!
#220: 	#ame You fucked up, Hawkins! What the fuck happened? Don't bother to answer that. You're too stupid to stay covered and your hands are shaking from all that jacking off you're doing every evening! You better try harder! All of you! Go!!!
#221: 	#ame Ah you stupid fuckers! Don't you dare fuck it again! You'll be digging trenches in concrete with spoons if you don't stat improving! Now get out there and wax 'em, you dogs!
#222: 	#ame Are you trying to wind me up? You goddamn oxygen waster, never ever try something that stupid again, you prick, or I'll tear you apart and hang your guts on the camp gates! Now get yourself ready, you're going again. Just don't screw it!
#223: 	#ame Good, Hawkins, you did it, but why the fuck did you take so long? Next time, let's get it done double time. Now get back here, all of you!
#224: 	#ame You sneaky bastard! But next time, grease all of those enemies! You have the flag, great! But two more seconds and you'll have caught a bullet in your head! Well done anyway. Now, get you asses over here!
#225: 	#ame And HAWKINS SCORES!!! Not bad. Not bad at all... Fuck I'm good, I've turned a pile of shit into a soldier. It's a goddamn miracle!
#226: 	#ame What the fuck are you doing, he's dead already!
#227: 	#ame Stop shooting at those guys, they're dead for christs sake!
#228: 	#ame He's dead! Can't you see his tiny little hands in the air! Stop shooting numbnuts!
#229: 	#ame Don't waste ammo on him, he's dead meat already! Stop fucking around!
#230: 	#ame You fucking cheese-dick! I told you: Don't shoot at the dead!
#1823: 	#ame Good morning ladies! Right! In the army, we call each other by first names. And my name is SERGEANT! And who the fuck are you, you little screw ups... Report yourself, motherfuckers!
#1827: 	#ame And I'm the unlucky son-of-a-bitch, who has to be your drill instructor. Why unlucky? Because you're the sorriest pile of shit that ever set foot in this drill camp! Soon, you will hate me, I can promise you this. I'm your worst goddamn nightmare! You'll obey my every word! Do you understand me, you three fat bags of dogshit!
#1840: 	#ame So here you are, in the Army, and in the Army things can go my way, or the wrong way! Do you get me, cock-suckers? I expect you know how to shuffle along on those stinking feet, or else you wouldn't have gotten here, but I'm gonna tell you how to move those sorry asses like goddamn US soldiers!
#1841: 	#ame Now move around a bit, shit-for-brains, so you can warm up for a little running! Don't worry, you'll enjoy it! That I promise! You're gonna sweat blood, whilst I tell you all the fun thing's you'll be doing... I said MOVE AROUND!!!
#1842: 	#ame We're gonna test those pissy little leg muscles! I bet they're weak as jello! But they'll get stronger, after we have a little one mile run... You think you know how to run? Wrong, assholes! You stick your ugly head too high and someone's gonna blow it off! I want to see you motherfuckers crouching all the way! 
#1843: 	#ame What are the chances of you sacks of shit being able to lift your disgusting asses off the ground? Not very good I expect. Well, you slack-jawed-faggots have got a minute to learn, and when I am done with you, you'll jump like your moma did when I showed her my pecker!
#1844: 	#ame But from the look of you, I doubt you could even lift one of your fucking feet off the ground! I hope for your sake numbnuts, that you can at least lie down on those massive bellies! Some of you bastards are so fat though, that it won't help much, your asses will be still too high, but this I can fix, and I will! Don't you worry about that!
#1845: 	#ame Now that you know how to use your legs properly, you can give it a try. You there, Hawkins, you seem like you have at least some idea of what the fuck I've been talking about! I doubt you got any more brains than the shit stains in my jocks , but maybe you can handle that kiddies obstacle course!
#1846: 	#ame So what in Gods name are you waiting for, you ratfuck! I told you to run the obstacle course, you useless piece of shit! Go to the beginning of the obstacle course and RUN! Move it! 
#1847: 	#ame Go go go! You want me to carry you through this, you fat piece of shit? I said GO! If you take much longer, I promise you'll be cleaning the latrines with your tongue, you lazy son-of-a-bitch!
#1848: 	#ame My grandma can move faster you asshole! And she's been dead for twenty years! I told you, RUN! You're almost as stupid, as you are ugly!
#1850: 	#ame Hey, numbnuts! I'm talking to you, get your fat ass back over here, you bastard!
#1851: 	#ame You don't understand English asshole? No habla, cheese-dick? Get back here!
#1852: 	#ame Are you deaf, or just ignoring me?! Get the fuck over here asswipe!!!
#1853: 	#ame You dumbass! I could shovel a ton of elephant shit into a uniform and it would be more of a soldier than you! I bet it would look better too!
#1854: 	#ame Dear God almighty! I know I have sinned, but what the fuck is this? I'd rather you struck me down with lightning, than give me this bunch of no-good, slack-jawed wasting pieces of shit!
#1855: 	#ame You trying to fuck with me... Well, how about I fuck with YOU, you dried-up smudge of rat piss?
#1859: 	#ame I said Run! Or else I'll come after you and make your balls a permanent fixture in your goddamn throat! And that's something you DO NOT want, believe me! RUN
#1860: 	#ame I've met only two bigger assholes than you, and I killed them both, you ratfuck! Move it!
#1861: 	#ame What the fuck was that, private? A drunken old woman could do better than that! Now try it again, shithead, with those two stupid pigfuckers here! And you better do it quick!
#1862: 	#ame Now you get your fat lazy ass back here you bag of shit! Move those fucking stumps you call legs!
#1863: 	#ame Now move to that fucking starting line, you lazy shits! You'll be racing each other, and the last one of you will be sorry he didn't hang himself on the umbilical cord when he was born! Now MOVE!
#1865: 	#ame Ready....
#1866: 	#ame Steady....
#1867: 	#ame Gooooooooo!!!!!!
#1868: 	#ame You'd better get this right you little faggot! C'mon! Move it! You run like a goddamn girlie ape! What the fuck is wrong with you?
#1869: 	#ame What the fuck do you think you are doing, you cock-sucking son-of-a-whore! AGAIN!!!
#1870: 	#ame You're the ugliest most stinking piece of shit I ever saw. Even a dead skunk smells better, and runs faster than you! Only thing you're good for is cesspit cleaning!
#1871: 	#ame You are going to run all day, if that is what it takes, you shiteating lazy, screw-up!
#1872: 	#ame Stop wiggling your ass like a little girl, and try to run like a man!
#1873: 	#ame You think I'm being a bit too nasty? Ahhh. Tough luck motherfucker! Why don't you go home play with your dolls instead of playing soldiers here with the big boys!
#1874: 	#ame Even a skunk would throw-up if the poor bastard had to smell you! So stop fucking about and run!
#1875: 	#ame You think I'm a jackass?! Well, I am only just warming up, you pussies. Now run, or I'll kick your shitty asses so hard, you'll be tying my laces with your tonque!
#1876: 	#ame You're sweating like a pig and smelling even worse but don't worry, there's plenty more to come!
#1877: 	#ame Although you got a face like spat out toffee, and you got about as much wit as the spunk stains on my sheets, you've completed this part of your training! Congratulations, asshole! But next time, it's going to be worse, I can swear! Now grab your gear and get ready for the next section!
#1878: 	#ame You three have just volunteered for latrine cleaning! Perfect job for shits like you!
#1880: 	#ame So, you do not give a fuck about my orders, you sorry excuse for a soldier! Who the fuck you think you are! You think you can screw with me? You're wrong! Piss me off once more and I'll tear your dick off and send you back to the girlies!
#1881: 	#ame What the good God is wrong with you, shithead! I'm the boss here! You will do as I say, or I'll tear you a new asshole. Again, motherfucker, do you hear me?
#1893: 	#ame Good morning ladies. So, you remembered. Well, I am genuinely surprised. Today you will be doing the thing soldiers are supposed to do! Shoot! This time on metal targets, but who knows, maybe some of you will have a chance to shoot at something live someday!
#1894: 	#ame Right, one thing you will never forget, ladies, and that is SAFETY! If one of you stupid fucks wants to screw with his weapon, I will personally ram that gun up his ass, is that understood, you sacks of shit!
#1895: 	#ame And if anyone of you is stupid enough to shoot himself, I will grab my gun and finish the job, and pay for the Goddamn bullet, assholes!
#1896: 	#ame Today, you'll just fire few shots to learn how it feels. Later you will be issued your personal weapon and you'll be caring for it like it's your girlfriend. If you ugly sons-of-bitches ever had a girlfriend, which I doubt! Right now it's just those training guns. 
#1897: 	#ame Although we have some better hardware than this, these good old Tommy guns are more than adequate for each of you. Grab 'em then, thay ain't gonna bite! NOW shit for brains!
#1899: 	#ame This guy here has some ammo for you... Whats the matter you cock-suckers? Go get some goddamn ammunition!
#2901: 	#ame Now get your fat butts to the firing positions! Green on the first, Hawkins on the second, Roy on third... MOVE IT!
#2902: 	#ame As soon as the target on your range goes up, shoot it! Fire at will!
#2906: 	#ame Now get down on your fat guts, and try shooting from prone position! Aim at those targets, asswipes, I wanna see some of you blind motherfuckers score at least one hit
#2908: 	#ame Well, you are still shooting like blind drunken lepers, but at least you can squeeze the trigger, mind you, even that seems like too much effort for you morons. Firing it in long bursts is usually good only to scare the enemy, and in bad movies. If you want to be accurate, you must shoot either with short bursts, or single shots. Switch your weapons on single shot mode, and try it again, see if you can hit something!
#2911: 	#ame Now we'll try something a bit more tricky! Get the fuck up and move to the second part of the range! Green on the fifth, Hawkins on the sixth, Roy on seventh position, move it pussies, we don't have all day!
#2914: 	#ame Get into firing positions, assholes. As soon as a target goes up, shoot it! They'll be coming up randomly and only for a few seconds, so do not hesitate and shoot! Imagine it's me wanting to fuck you up the ass! Get ready! Fire at will!
#2916: 	#ame Aim you goddamn idiots! Don't fuck with me cheese dicks! Any target you miss means another hour polishing the goddamn latrines!
#2917: 	#ame Oh my God... Come on you pussies! You're lucky they're just targets! Live enemies would've already turned you into sieves! Shooooooot you imbeciles!
#2918: 	#ame Where the hell are you aiming, you dumb fucks?! Are you trying to fuck with me?! Target is the enemy, NOT SOME FUCKIN' CLOUD!!! AIM!!!
#2919: 	#ame This is a gun you are holding, asswipes, not a toothpick or an asspick or anything else for that matter! Aim and shoot! 
#2920: 	#ame Jesus! If you accidently end up in some firefight, you'd better throw your gun at the enemy, you'll do more damage! Aim, don't just fuck around with it! AIM!!!
#2921: 	#ame Not bad, Hawkins, for such an incompetent fuck like you! Maybe I can make a soldier from you after all, but it'll take a long time! Maybe you'll not be cleaning those latrines today, but there's time yet...
#2922: 	#ame You call yourself a soldier! You know how to aim, you know how to shoot, you stupid bastard, so why the fuck aren't you doing it?! You're lucky you hit at least something, or else you'd be already on the way to latrines with a toothbrush! But don't worry, the day is not over yet!
#2923: 	#ame Hawkins, you fucking shitbag, you trying to fuck with me or what?! WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! You were supposed to SHOOT those targets down! I'll tear you apart, God help me, you dumb sonofabitch! Do something like this again and I will send you back to the hole you crawled from, you fucking imbecile!
#2924: 	#ame We're gonna try some sharpshooting now, assholes! And I hope you'd do better than that last pile of shit! Go over to the table and get those sniper rifles! And of course leave tommies there! Move it!
#2927: 	#ame Now get back here, assholes! Move it! Or do want me to carry you!
#2929: 	#ame This is a sniper rifle! It has a sniperscope attached to it, so you can aim and shoot accurately over long distances! So get ready assholes, you each have a target of your own just infront of the wall! It will go up three times! And I want you to hit it everytime, do you hear me?! Every time!
#2930: 	#ame Get ready! Fire at will! Let's see what you ladies can do!
#2932: 	#ame Welll, Hawkins, it seems I was wrong about you! You are not only an ugly stupid motherfucker! You're an ugly stupid motherfucker who knows how to shoot! That's good, because there's still hope I'll make you a soldier one day! Today you're going to clean only your stuff! Latrines will wait for tommorow!
#2933: 	#ame It wasn't a complete disaster you stupid blind faggots! You hit something, yes, but it wasn't ENOUGH, you slack fucker! I think we should do a little exercise this evening before your favourite latrine cleaning, you lazy little shits! Just a brief ten miles cross country running with full gear! Oh yeah! And it's going to be same everytime you screw up target practice like this!
#2934: 	#ame Mary mother of God... You blind morons! You blind sons of whores! You couldn't hit a goddamn elephant if you stuck your head up it's ass! I never seen anyone shooting like this, you look like fuckin' junior with his water pistol! Do it once again and I'll grab my gun and show you how it's done, you ratfucks! I swear! All of you have got extra duties for next week! And that's just the beginning!
#2935: 	#ame Get your gear cheese-dicks! The day's not over yet and we got enough time to do some more soldiering! Move it assholes!
#2936: 	#ame Hawkins, you idiot, why the hell are you taking that one? I thought I told you what gun to take!
#2937: 	#ame Hawkins, do not fuck with me! Put that gun down and take the one I told you to! At the moment your pushing your freakin' luck! Carry out my orders, asshole, and take the correct gun!
#2938: 	#ame YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKER!!! What the fuck have you done?! I'll kill you myself with my bare hands, you dumb fuck!
#2939: 	#ame HOLY DOGSHIT He's going crazy! Shoot that motherfucker before he does it again!
#2940: 	#ame YOU FUCKIN' IDIOT! I'll kill you, you crazy bastard! I'll get you for this one!
#2941: 	#ame Mother... Fucker... I'll... killll... you...
#2953: 	#ame Soldiers, now you will test fire some of the bigger hardware! You'll enjoy it, but God help you if you screw something up, I'll fuck you up the ass, until your balls drop off!
#2954: 	#ame We will start with a mounted machine gun and some claymores! All of us will be protected here in the bunker just in case some shithead screws up. Hawkins, you're such a smartass, you'll be delighted to go first, right?! After my orders, you will run to your firing position.
#2955: 	#ame There are paper targets which are attacking your position. You better fear those targets Hawkins, because if you don't manage to kill them all, I'll come down on you like a ton of bricks! You have a machine gun and three claymores in your bunker. Use the clackers to fire all the claymores and hose the rest of the targets with MG fire. Understood asswipe? 
#2960: 	#ame You have an order shithead! What are you waiting for, the targets ain't gonna kill themselves!
#2961: 	#ame If those targets do not get shot down in next few seconds, you definitely will! Where's my gun?! I'll teach that asshole...
#2962: 	#ame Hawkins, don't fuck with me! Destroy those targets as you were ordered, or else I'll throw you at them!
#2963: 	#ame Soldier, I am waiting and my rage is getting bigger and bigger with each passing second! Now destroy those targets! And do not fuck with me, asshole!
#2964: 	#ame What THE FUCK are you waiting for?! If this was for real you'd be dead three times over, you stupid shit-licking ratfuck! Kill those targets!
#2965: 	#ame Hawkins, you braindead idiot! I told you to use those fucking mines! But no, Mister Smartass thinks he can do it his way! But you are wrong! As is said before, in the army there two ways, the wrong way and my way, and you just chose the wrong way, asshole! You really pissed me off shit-for-brains! You're finished today and I doubt you'll ever get back here, least not in my lifetime!
#2966: 	#ame Good, you destroyed them. Not bad, Hawkins, but it could be definitely been better! You're swinging that MG like a crazy fool, but you'll get the hang eventually. Now the others are going to try it. But first we must erect some new targets...
#2967: 	#ame Hawkins, what the fuck were you waiting for? You wanted them to get closer, or what?! Now don't fuck me, when I'll tell you next time kill those targets you'll do it and do it fast, do you get me?! Now get back here and watch Private Green, he'll show you how to do it! But first we must erect new targets, damn...
#2968: 	#ame Now we'll try the frags! These are basic hand grenades, with a four second time fuse. You just pull the safety pin out, aim and throw, that is all! Hawkins, on my order you'll run to the fire position, take grenades from the crate and start throwing them at the targets down there! There's some proper paper soldiers and an APC. You will destroy them all as fast as possible! Is that clear?
#2969: 	#ame So, run to your goddamn position and kill them all! Fire at will, go go go!
#2970: 	#ame So... Get your lazy ass down there, double time! Go go go!
#2975: 	#ame Good, work! You were busy throwing stones at your neigbourhood windows when you were young, weren't you, Hawkins? Who knows, maybe you'll get promoted to corporal in few years. Now let's put those targets back so the others can try it!
#2976: 	#ame Hawkins, you incompetent asshole! These are not bunches of flowers you are chuckin' around! These are grenades! They have even more destructive power than me when I get drunk! And you took so much time to destroy those targets that I could've got drunk four times over, you shithead! You need practice, limp-wrist! You'll report to me at seven P.M. and you'll be throwing practise frags until your hand falls off, understood? Now let's put some more targets there, go, you lazy bastards, go!
#2977: 	#ame Now, this is my favourite, soldiers! This is the M79 grenade launcher, or Blooper. This is my baby! You load, aim, shoot and KABOOM! Good night sweetheart! Hawkins, there are some targets waiting for you! There's also case with more ammo, if you'll need it, but you'd better destroy the paper tanks and soldiers with as few as possible, those babies are quite expensive! Understood?
#2978: 	#ame Run for it, Private, and kill them all! Move!
#2982: 	#ame Well look at what we have here, a mean, lean killing machine! But not as mean and lean as me, don't you ever forget that Hawkins! Good job! Give me back the launcher and go put more targets out for the others.
#2983: 	#ame Hawkins! I could destroy those targets ten times faster just by pissing and spitting on them! This is no kiddies toy, this is a gun! Do something like this once more and you'll never touch the blooper again. Understood you asshole?! Now run back there and put new targets up! Move it!
#2984: 	#ame Now here comes the last part! Although I must admit some of you assholes are slightly smarter than chimpanzees, but this is probably gonna be more than you'll manage, so I'll finally get to beat some of you senseless for incompetence! It's calling fire support next, you sacks of shit!
#2985: 	#ame Another squad of sorry sons-of-bitches only a bit better than you chimps, is stationed nearby with mortars. You'll use your map to aim their fire at two groups of targets. Each one of you can call them five times, but even God almighty himself will not save you, if you call five times and the targets are still standing!
#2986: 	#ame Hawkins, you're going first. You have a map? Good. Go to the position with private Bleems, look where those targets are, consult your fucking map and tell him where you want the mortars to aim at. He'll relay the coords to them with radio. Understood?
#2987: 	#ame So what are you waiting for? GO!
#2992: 	#ame HAWKINS! You fucking moron! What have I told you, you incompetent asshole? You had five tries and I still see goddamn targets!!! That was absolutely useless! And I was starting to think you weren't such waste of space after all! Get your toothbrush and report yourself at latrines at seven pm soldier!
#2993: 	#ame Hey hey, Hawkins! You've surprised me! You actually managed to destroy them with two accurate calls! Good job! You can buy me beer this evening, while the others will be polishing the latrines! Wait here, you other sons-of-bitches, go prepare the targets!
#2994: 	#ame You're one lucky son-of-a-bitch, private! I was pretty sure you'd screw it, but maybe you are not as fucking dumb as you look! But next time you'll get those co-ords absolutely spot on, and destroy those targets with only two calls, understood? Now get your lazy asses out there, and put up the new targets!
#2995: 	#ame Right, you sorry sacks of shit! Today could either be good fun, or your worst friggin' nightmare! You were issued blanks with wax slugs, so you'll not die if hit by one. If you piss me off though, I'll ram those fucking blanks up your ass!
#2996: 	#ame If you'll get hit by a wax slug, throw your weapon down and touch the fucking sky! Any of you shits who try to shoot after he's hit will be hit again! BY ME! Understood, cock-smokers?
#2997: 	#ame Hawkins, you're leading Blue team! Red team is already stationed on the playground. You have to fight through them and reach the flag at the opposite end. Those fucker's are even worse than you, it should be easy, you chimps. Since you're stupid, I'd better repeat the basics:
#2998: 	#ame Move only when those fuckers with blue helmets are covering you with fire. Shoot any pussy with a red helmet, but do NOT stand in the middle and shoot like some motherfucking cowboy. Keep your sorry ass behind an obstacle and shoot over it. As soon as you think you have an opening, run for the flag! Understood, Hawkins?
#2999: 	#ame So go, boys! Tear those red headed fuckers new assholes! Go go go! And do not fail me, or you'll regret it, fatties! Go!
#8663: 	#ame Good morning, people. The time has come for a little retribution. We're going to strike at an enemy target in Khe Areh Valley. Fortified hill Po Tlong Karai. Captain Rosenfield from A-252 will brief you.
#501: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. We have reached checkpoint Bravo , over. 
#503: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. Contact is negative, I say again, negative. VC withdrew to the north. Over.
#505: 	#ame Roger that, Six. This is One. Out.
#510: 	#ame OK, Nhut, let's try and find where Charlie's disappeared to. 
#512: 	#ame Follow their tracks.
#513: 	#ame Nhut, you hear that? What’s going on?
#515: 	#ame I found a wounded Yard! Over here!
#516: 	#ame Let's go.
#522: 	#ame Shit, a wounded civilian.
#523: 	#ame Doc, I got a wounded civilian, here.
#524: 	#ame Shit! He looks in a bad way.
#525: 	#ame Right, let's patch this fella up.
#527: 	#ame Hmmm... A banana clip. VC have been through here for sure.
#530: 	#ame Here Doc, let me help.
#539: 	#ame Sorry, I don't understand. I need Nhut, he should be able to translate.
#540: 	#ame Please take us to your village.
#542: 	#ame Where is your village?
#544: 	#ame We need to get to the VIL-LA-GE!
#550: 	#ame Ask him to take us to the village.
#553: 	#ame Let’s hope we’ll scare the VC off.
#554: 	#ame Stay alert, people, keep your eyes peeled for anything suspicious...
#567: 	#ame Defort, get me HQ.
#572: 	#ame Tell him we are glad we could help.
#575: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. VC preparing attack on the Bahnar village. Request air support, over. 
#577: 	#ame Six, this is One, roger that chopper. We are gonna spoil their day! Out.
#578: 	#ame Chopper's on the way, should be easy...
#579: 	#ame I'm gonna ask for an evac... Hotel Six, this is Spike One. Bahnar village was attacked, several VC KIA some withdrew to the North. Request immediate extraction. Over.
#581: 	#ame Thanks Six, we'll pop smoke. Get the beer ready for when we get back. Spike One out.
#589: 	#ame That'll teach those sneaky fucks a lesson they won't forget in a hurry! 
#590: 	#ame Let's get in that slick and get the fuck outta town.
#592: 	#ame Right! Let's move out.
#600: 	#ame We'll cross AO to the northeast, searching for any signs of Charlie. Take point, Nhut.
#603: 	#ame OK, let's go.
#604: 	#ame Continue towards the canyons!
#606: 	#ame Come on Nhut, let's go!
#607: 	#ame Get the Bird on the horn...
#616: 	#ame Stay sharp people, I'm getting some bad vibes from this place.
#627: 	#ame OK... stay well back, I'll check it out.
#629: 	#ame Nasty... Punji whip trap!
#634: 	#ame You see something strange Nhut? Where?
#635: 	#ame A trip-wire grenade trap!
#636: 	#ame Sneaky... Hole filled with punji stakes.
#638: 	#ame Wait here. I’ll remove the traps.
#642: 	#ame More traps.
#645: 	#ame Nasty, punji pit!
#651: 	#ame I can almost smell the VC bastards...
#653: 	#ame Pass me the Horn, Defort. I wanna send a sitrep!
#655: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One, over.
#657: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One. We're near the edge of the jungle. The path was heavily boobytrapped with punji's and grenade foot traps. We had brief contact with a small VC squad who withdrew to the north-east. We're gonna continue after ‘em. Over.
#663: 	#ame Six, this is One, wilco, out.
#664: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. Over.
#665: 	#ame Shhh, down there - I don't think they've seen us.
#672: 	#ame Booby trap.
#673: 	#ame Holy shit, this is one of our own M26 fragmentation grenades on a trip wire, the thieving bastards!
#674: 	#ame Nhut, lead us down to the canyon. We’ll follow Charlie along his trail.
#676: 	#ame Follow the VC.
#677: 	#ame Continue on Charlie’s trail.
#681: 	#ame Even more reason for us to scope this place out, let's go.
#688: 	#ame Find the tracks of the VC, we will follow them.
#689: 	#ame Follow the VC.
#692: 	#ame Damn it!
#693: 	#ame Lead us up there.
#695: 	#ame Stay on their trail. 
#696: 	#ame Continue.
#701: 	#ame -
#702: 	#ame Continue to the canyon as planned, and be prepared for another encounter, I’m betting there’s more gooks yet to come.
#703: 	#ame Continue to the canyon.
#704: 	#ame Hmm, we’ll enter the jungle and move north east to find the way to the first canyon. Our task is to search the area for enemy activity.
#705: 	#ame Weird, we’re in dense jungle but this path seems quite well trodden. Maybe Charlie’s using it...
#706: 	#ame Right, go cautiously through the canyon, there could be more of them.
#707: 	#ame Continue through the canyon.
#708: 	#ame Nhut, let’s go up this path. Looks like it’ll lead to the draw bridge we saw. 
#709: 	#ame  Let’s get to that draw bridge.
#710: 	#ame Nhut, cross this bridge, we’ll cover you. This looks like the way to the second canyon.
#711: 	#ame Continue to the second canyon.
#712: 	#ame Okey Nhut, let’s move to the second canyon. Lead us there.
#713: 	#ame Hmm. The canyon ends here. We need to find a different route to the second canyon!
#714: 	#ame The plan is to go through this canyon southeast and find a route to the second one. Gotta search the area for enemy activity.
#715: 	#ame We are actually in the first canyon. From here we should be able to get to the other one.
#716: 	#ame Ahh, looks like we are on our way to the next canyon...
#717: 	#ame Damn! Charlie’s got a whole weapons store stashed down there!
#718: 	#ame Lead us to the stream.
#719: 	#ame There is beaucoup enemy activity in this area. Search the forest next to the stream for enemy caches. Watch out for VC.
#720: 	#ame Search the area for enemy caches.
#721: 	#ame We should try to find a different way round. Nhut, lead us over this cliff.
#724: 	#ame Shh, looks like this leads somewhere...
#726: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. We just had another contact. Unknown number of enemy forces. Seems like they withdrew over a rope bridge to the area of the second canyon. This area's hotter than we thought, over.
#728: 	#ame This is Spike One, that's a negative, Six. We're gonna continue patrol, over.
#731: 	#ame A sign? Possibly for caches, or boobytraps?
#732: 	#ame Search the area for caches.
#734: 	#ame So let's have a look what's in Charlie's store today.
#735: 	#ame Hot damn! There must be a ton of rice here!
#736: 	#ame Right, let's light these caches up.
#737: 	#ame Some C-4 should do the job!
#739: 	#ame Get us out of this shit-hole.
#740: 	#ame Sitrep, Defort! Pass me that handset buddy.
#741: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One, over.
#743: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One, we've found and destroyed an enemy rice cache. Continuing in planned direction, over. 
#745: 	#ame Let’s bug outta here...
#746: 	#ame Shit. VC camp!
#747: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One, over. 
#749: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. We just engaged a VC squad, and found their camp. Enemy withdrew to South East. The camp looks like it was used by a large group last night, over.
#751: 	#ame Let's get a nice chunk of C-4 in there.
#753: 	#ame Nhut, find us a less busy way through.
#754: 	#ame Thanks Six, Spike One out.
#755: 	#ame Thanks Six, this is Spike One, out.
#756: 	#ame Lead us to the village. 
#757: 	#ame Roger Six, Spike One out.
#764: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. 
#766: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One, we made contact with squad of VC. Negative friendly casualties. Enemy caches found and destroyed, over. 
#768: 	#ame Roger Six, out.
#769: 	#ame We must follow the Khe Bana stream, codenamed checkpoint Blue, along both canyons and reach checkpoint Bravo, the Bahnar village. Gotta search for gook activity and find ourselves some enemy caches along the way.
#770: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy, over.
#772: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Made contact with small VC unit. Missing man still not found.
#773: 	#ame It seems like I‘m somewhere in the middle of the jungle, I think there should be another tunnel entrance somewhere, but I haven’t found it yet. Over.
#774: 	#ame I have found another tunnel entrance. I am going to investigate. Over.
#776: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Roger that, out.
#800: 	#ame That's one out the way. Now where's the second?
#801: 	#ame Looks like the job's nearly done. Just gotta clear the few remaining Charlie.
#802: 	#ame Now, where’s that escape route?
#803: 	#ame This must be the other way outta here.
#809: 	#ame I reckon the rest of the gooks escaped through there. 
#811: 	#ame So?
#813: 	#ame Yeah, might as well finish the job.
#815: 	#ame One step ahead sir, I did it already.
#850: 	#ame No chance without a ladder.
#862: 	#ame Oh Jesus. That's Marv!
#863: 	#ame C'mon man. Hold on, I'm comin' for you!
#869: 	#ame Scratch those gook motherfuckers... Now where's Marv?
#870: 	#ame Shit, shit, shit! Gook bastards! Let's hope I can find him in time.
#871: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. Do you read me? Over.
#873: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Bad news. Marv is possible Whiskey India Alpha. He's with several VC soldiers. Over.
#875: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Roger. Be careful with those choppers, Six, they'll kill him if they see any air-support. Shrew One, out.
#876: 	#ame More bunks. Nice and quiet...
#877: 	#ame Damned punji.
#878: 	#ame They can't vanish. There must be another tunnel.
#879: 	#ame Weapons store. I'd better stock up...
#880: 	#ame Thank Christ! I can smell fresh air!
#881: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. Do you copy? Over.
#900: 	#ame Damn tunnels. How the hell can I get back up.
#903: 	#ame Shit. This ain't the right way.
#904: 	#ame I've been here before.
#905: 	#ame Why do they bother digging such freakin' long tunnels. 
#906: 	#ame Ahh. What's this...
#907: 	#ame Empty...
#908: 	#ame I got a feeling that this is the wrong way.
#909: 	#ame I'm sure I've already been down here.
#910: 	#ame I've been down here before.
#911: 	#ame These narrow tunnels fuck me up.
#912: 	#ame Shit... Somebody is near.
#916: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy, over.
#918: 	#ame Six, this is Shew One. I've found a small room, it's empty though. Missing man not found yet. Over.
#920: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Wilco, out.
#921: 	#ame Gooks must've been here a few minutes ago.
#922: 	#ame VC storage room...
#923: 	#ame Shit, these are brand new, American M-26 grenades!
#925: 	#ame Shit, these traps are deadly in such a small space.
#927: 	#ame Eat this, gook!
#928: 	#ame Firefights are nasty down here...
#929: 	#ame I'll teach you a lesson, slope motherfucker!
#930: 	#ame Fuck. He's running.
#931: 	#ame Have a dirt-nap on me, bastards.
#932: 	#ame Shit, VC have got some number one shit here!
#933: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy? Over.
#935: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Goddamn tunnels. I'm some distance from your position. Found a few boobytraps and encountered some VC. All KIA. Still haven't found our man. Over.
#937: 	#ame Wilco Six, Shrew One out.
#938: 	#ame Shit. Another shaft leading down. 
#944: 	#ame There's something going on down here...
#949: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy, over.
#951: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. I have found the tunnel exit, which leads out in to the jungle. Cannot find any sign of our Papa Oscar Whiskey, Marv. Over.
#953: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Roger that, sir, out.
#961: 	#ame There were two VCs here. They can't just disappear...
#962: 	#ame Sneaky bastards have got a secret tunnel.
#963: 	#ame The tunnel seems to end here? Goddamn VC rat-holes!
#964: 	#ame Fuck me! Where are these assholes coming from?
#965: 	#ame Dead end! Can't go any further.
#966: 	#ame Oh Shit! There's more...
#967: 	#ame Mother fuckers! You gotta be crawling from somewhere. Eat this!
#968: 	#ame Jesus. More of 'em. Take this, rice eaters!
#969: 	#ame Holy shit! I've woken up a whole battalion of 'em!
#970: 	#ame Where are these gooks appearing from?
#971: 	#ame Shit... I thought I'd cleared this area!
#972: 	#ame They must be coming out a secret tunnel somewhere...
#973: 	#ame I gotta find where these guys are coming from...
#974: 	#ame I can't get in that bunker from here.
#976: 	#ame A way through!
#977: 	#ame At last, this seems to lead somewhere!
#978: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy? Over.
#980: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Left tunnels for short while, crossed small section of jungle, and found another section of tunnels. I also found a tiger hat, with blood on it. I'm going to examine these tunnels. I reckon Marv must be near! Over. 
#982: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. I'm on it! Out.
#983: 	#ame Shit, this looks like a tiger suit hat. Marv must've dragged down here...
#1321: 	#ame I wonder who that’s gonna be...
#1326: 	#ame Yeah, looks that fuckin' way.
#1329: 	#ame OK, I’m on it. Out.
#1331: 	#ame Fuck it! Just what I needed.
#1332: 	#ame That should do the trick.
#1333: 	#ame Time to get on that slick and bug the hell out of a dodge.
#1334: 	#ame Well, that should buy us some time!
#1338: 	#ame There goes number two...
#1339: 	#ame Let's hope that holds, I ain't coming back...
#1340: 	#ame Hawk One, come in, it's Hawkins. C-4 is set, I need a lift, pronto! Over.
#1402: 	#ame This is Shrew One, wilco Six. We are in the area now. Over.
#1403: 	#ame Holy shit! Here they are...
#1406: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One, made contact with the VC squad. Found Shrew Three, they're in a real bad way, sir. Over.
#1408: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Casualty report for Shrew Three is as follows. Two Kilo India Alpha and two missing. Also, one WIA, need dustoff ASAP. I think we're being setup for a counter attack sir. Over. 
#1421: 	#ame Shit, here they come again.
#1423: 	#ame Dustoff, this is Shrew One. Do you copy, over.
#1425: 	#ame Dustoff, this is Shrew One. Copy that. Popping smoke... Over.
#1427: 	#ame This is Shrew One. Roger Dustoff. Confirm yellow smoke. Repeat, affirmative on yellow smoker. Over.
#1429: 	#ame Dustoff, this is Shrew One. Roger suspected enemy movement northeast of our LOCSIT. We'll check it out. Thanks guys. Over.
#1430: 	#ame Nhut, we're looking for the two GI's. Follow Charlie's tracks.
#1432: 	#ame Keep your eyes peeled for blood trails, and watch we don't get ambushed, let's not forget we're in Indian country. This is their freakin' turf we're on now.
#1433: 	#ame Continue.
#1441: 	#ame Shit, this is Sergeant Jack O’Neil!
#1444: 	#ame Hold on Sergeant, we're here now, you're gonna be fine.
#1445: 	#ame Oh no. Don’t die, man, don't fuckin' die on me man... FUCK IT, MAN!
#1447: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. Over.
#1449: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. We made contact with large VC unit. All enemies were eliminated or withdrew. We found one of the MIA’s, but it was too late for him. No sign of Marv yet, and we still haven't found a way in to the tunnels, over. 
#1451: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Roger that, out.
#1463: 	#ame Here it is... Well fuck me, this looks dangerous!
#1465: 	#ame I need to get down there quick, start looking for Marv.
#1467: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. Over.
#1470: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. I've cleared the bunkers here, no trace of our missing man. Over.
#1472: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Wilco, out.
#1478: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Confirmed. I can hear the gooks talking though, sir. I think they're gonna hit us soon. Over.
#1480: 	#ame Six, this is One. What about the MIA's? Over.
#1482: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Roger, we'll get 'em back. Over.
#1486: 	#ame We still gotta find Marv. I will contact Captain for instructions. 
#1488: 	#ame Nhut, follow the VC tracks. Marv is still missing. We need to find him.
#1491: 	#ame Continue Nhut. Marv is still missing. We need to find him.
#1492: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. We made contact with VC group hidden in the old French bunker. We have found Sergeant O’Neil, KIA. He needs to be dusted off. Marv's still MIA. Over.
#1494: 	#ame Roger Six, Shrew One out. 
#1531: 	#ame Let‘s go!
#1601: 	#ame Yeah, I'm glad we managed to win 'em over, I was surprised how many Charlie there were in the jungle, though.
#1611: 	#ame Damn, can't get past.
#1615: 	#ame Fuck me! They're really goin' for it!
#1626: 	#ame Hornster, get your ass over here, I need some back-up.
#1629: 	#ame Good work, Ong. Stay put.
#1635: 	#ame Shit, I'll get after them!
#1643: 	#ame I'll tell Rosenfield...
#1644: 	#ame Six, this is Hawkins. We found the tunnel they used to get in! I'm going inside to seal it with C-4. Over.
#1647: 	#ame Sorry Brons, you'll get your chance. Chuck us some of that C-4. I'm going in.
#1650: 	#ame Six, this is Hawkins. Roger. Out.
#1651: 	#ame This is a shitty place for a fire fight.
#1652: 	#ame I'll put the C-4 here.
#1653: 	#ame I'd better get back. It's gonna get messy in here in a few seconds.
#1654: 	#ame If I pop my head out there, it's gonna get blown off.
#1655: 	#ame Fuck, there's tons of 'em!
#1656: 	#ame C-4 planted. You can blow it now, Bronson.
#1704: 	#ame Coming.
#1765: 	#ame Six, this is Eye Two. They'll lick their wounds for a while, but they’ll be back in... INCOMING... ...Shit!!!... 
#1766: 	#ame Or maybe they'll try to beat the shit out of us with mortars. Over.

#2334: 	#ame This propaganda’s pretty lame.
#2335: 	#ame They didn’t really try with this one.
#2336: 	#ame Would this persuade anyone? I doubt it!
#2337: 	#ame Up your ass, commies.
#2338: 	#ame More commie rubbish!
#2339: 	#ame News straight from the politburo. 
#2340: 	#ame More commie propaganda.

#2391: 	#ame Lenin. The son of a bitch that started it all.
#2392: 	#ame Lenin, famous commie guy...
#2393: 	#ame Uncle Stalin - pretty cute. Probably neck-shot the kid after the picture was taken.

#2574: 	#ame The LLDB Colonel gave me this one, Military Merit Medal, for assisting in the defense of Nui Pek Camp. Too bad our Captain didn’t pin a US gong on my chest too, you can never have enough scrap metal.
#2575: 	#ame Silver Star, man... But I earned it the hard way. Those tunnels are still giving me nightmares...
#2576: 	#ame This was for the POW hunting in the swamps. God knows why I got this medal though, I was just a grunt on the ground, not some POET in a talking bird, but why the hell not, a medal is a medal.
#2577: 	#ame Those guys at the LLDB outpost were really generous, they managed to get me this RVN Gallantry Cross, which is definitely something to be proud of.
#2578: 	#ame The Bronze Star medal, not as esteemed as the Silver Star, but hey, it’s mine. They gave it to me after the action at the Radio Relay.
#2579: 	#ame Oh man... Distinguished Service Cross. It still amazes me, every time I look at it. But it was earned the hard way. Got it for the attack on the Po Tlong Karai and the tunnels and swamp I trawled through afterwards.
#2580: 	#ame I took this from a dead Bahnar villager... Makes me angry. I could have saved them, but failed. Damn...
#2581: 	#ame This is another RVN medal, for honor. I suppose landing in the middle of a whole fucking NVA battalion and blowing the bridge up, right under their noses, should be rewarded. Yeah, definitely!
#2582: 	#ame Biere la Rue, local beer, also known as Tiger piss.
#3002: 	#ame I’m a bit shook up - but I’m OK.
#3006: 	#ame We must be somewhere around here... In Khe Areh valley, about half a klick south of Po Tlong Karai.

#3079: 	#ame Bravo, this is Alpha. Repeat. We crashed in the jungle. We’ll be there ASAP. Keep your asses down 'til we get there, over.
#3102: 	#ame These guys know where the action is - follow them.
#3104: 	#ame Get in position, let them come at us!
#3105: 	#ame Hold this position!
#3109: 	#ame Quit that grabass, and stay focused.
#3116: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Snake Two, do you copy? Over.
#3118: 	#ame Six, this is Snake Two. Roger, no gunfire. Wilco. Out.
#3119: 	#ame Thanks Sir. Here is the one POW we grabbed.
#3120: 	#ame Hold position. No shooting!
#3121: 	#ame Hold your fire!

#3151: 	#ame Six, this is Snake Two. Roger that. Setting up ambush. Out.
#3158: 	#ame Secure that horseshit, Hornster. Let's hope when they capture you, they don't feel the same way.
#3159: 	#ame Our task is to help Snake One defend their line. The VC will be coming from the bombarded area east of it.
#3160: 	#ame There's a large VC group advancing toward us from the north. We need to set up an ambush.
#3163: 	#ame OK, this is an excellent killing zone. Get into position.

#3204: 	#ame Wilco Six, out.
#3206: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. Made contact with small squad of VC. I‘ve reached the village near checkpoint Delta. The village is empty, looks like civvies left a couple of hours ago. Must’ve left in a hurry, all their stuff is still here. It looks kind of strange. Over. 
#3208: 	#ame Roger that Six, Shrew One out.
#3209: 	#ame Hmm, where am I? The river ends over there, and there’s a village... Aaah I think I must be round here somewhere.

#3219: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. Wilco. Out.
#3221: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Shrew One. Near the big blue line. Over.
#3222: 	#ame I should follow the river to get to the area near checkpoint Delta. 
#3225: 	#ame Shit - there goes the C-4. Charlie'll be right on my tail.
#3226: 	#ame Come get some, dink motherfuckers!

#3283: 	#ame Hawk One, this is Shrew One. You wouldn't fuckin' believe where I'm talking to you from! Send Hotel Six a message that I'm still kickin' ass, and I have found some interesting intel for them. I still haven't found the Papa Oscar Whiskey, though. Over.
#3285: 	#ame Hawk, this is Shrew One. Thanks man, out. 
#3286: 	#ame This radio looks like the ideal place for a quarter block of C-4.
#3287: 	#ame Charlie'll get a surprise when he turns the radio on.
#3289: 	#ame Wow, they got freakin' schoolrooms down here!
#3290: 	#ame Shit. It looks like these guys know the layout of Nui Pek just perfectly...
#3291: 	#ame Now I've seen everything...
#3292: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. Do you copy? Over.
#3295: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. I'm in a full blown underground city. Right now I'm in a large room looking like a VC hospital, just below the surface. Still no sign of Marv. Over.
#3297: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. I get the same feeling. Out.
#3298: 	#ame Shit, there's another little room! They've been busy down here!
#3299: 	#ame Must be able to get out through there...
#3300: 	#ame Where the hell are the others?
#3301: 	#ame Hmm, I’ve come out several hundred meters above the tunnel entrance. I must be near the top. 
#3306: 	#ame I thought I heard something, is he alright? 
#3309: 	#ame He’s more adept at destroying things. Defort, get me the Captain.
#3311: 	#ame Crocker, stay here and wait for the others. Defort, you’re coming with me.
#3317: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fist Alpha, do you read me? Over.
#3319: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. We climbed up the hill using their tunnel system. We are near the ruins, have visual contact. 
#3320: 	#ame Team has been separated, half of the team is still in the tunnel, trying to fix collapsed ladder. Over.
#3322: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. That’s a negative. We're just separated. Over.
#3324: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. Affirmative. Over.

#3361: 	#ame You’re welcome, man. 
#3363: 	#ame You ok? Better stay here, it’s pretty hot upstairs. I’ll send you a medic ASAP.
#3364: 	#ame Stay here. 
#3374: 	#ame Gimme the horn, I found something.
#3376: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fist Alpha. I think I’ve found their leader, but I had to kill him. I've secured some intel from him though. Over.
#3377: 	#ame Six, I’ve gone one better and managed to free our POWs as well. Over.
#3379: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. Wilco. Out.
#3390: 	#ame Hmm, he was one tough gook. I hope he was worth the trouble.
#3391: 	#ame Well this is definitely interesting. Our intelligence guys are gonna cream themselves!
#3423: 	#ame Blue Bird's been hit!
#3430: 	#ame Fucking gooks.
#3448: 	#ame Roger Six, of course. Over.
#3450: 	#ame This is Fox One. I'll let you know how we're doing, Six. Over.
#3451: 	#ame Thank God, we found you! Are you alright? Any injuries?
#3453: 	#ame I'll request extraction, we'll call in support to pick up the guys at the downed slick when we're on the chopper.
#3454: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Fox One, we've found the pilot. Over.
#3456: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Fox One. Thanks, we need extraction now. Over.
#3457: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Fox One, wilco, out.

#3540: 	#ame Yes, sir.
#3548: 	#ame Crocker, what about moving to the other side?
#3552: 	#ame I’ll try and make it up that hill!
#3554: 	#ame Let’s follow them, quick!
#3556: 	#ame Don’t worry too much, Crocker, let’s go see if this one is mortal, ok? Follow me.
#3558: 	#ame Over there.

#3566: 	#ame Two VCs KIA.
#3567: 	#ame All VCs KIA.
#3568: 	#ame Rest of them escaped to the jungle.
#3569: 	#ame All of 'em escaped to the jungle.
#3574: 	#ame That’s all of ‘em.
#3626: 	#ame Fuck, they’re good. Must stay in cover...
#3627: 	#ame Shit! Gotta be more careful
#3628: 	#ame Damn, gotta stay covered.
#3629: 	#ame Where’d they go?
#3630: 	#ame Captain said we’re going to the Jarai village to drop off some supplies. Looks like it’s south from where we are now...
#3701: 	#ame Nhut! Head over to Shrew Two! 
#3703: 	#ame Move up to Shrew Two, Nhut!
#3707: 	#ame Nhut! Get us over that bridge and up to that bunker on the right! 
#3709: 	#ame Nhut! We gotta move up to them bunkers!

#3712: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew, Roger that Six. Understand, stay in contact, cross river and attack position. Wilco. Out.
#3720: 	#ame We gotta find these tanks. If intel is correct, they're near here.
#3722: 	#ame Let’s find these tanks.
#3723: 	#ame If they had a heavy MG up here, we would have been screwed. 
#3725: 	#ame What?
#3728: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. All we have here is old French junk tanks, Six, no military value. Over.
#3730: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. There are no military targets here. These are just old French tank hulls, just scrap metal, Six! Request instructions. Over.
#3732: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew, repeat, need new instructions! I'm gonna pull my men out, we can hear enemy activity close by, over!
#3734: 	#ame Damn. These aren't Russian tanks, they're old French ones. That's why they're falling apart! Shit... Recon should have picked that up.
#3738: 	#ame Thanks Shrew Two, let’s hope we make it.
#3739: 	#ame  Nhut, let’s get over this bridge, quickly. 
#3740: 	#ame Let’s go, we gotta catch up with Shrew Three.
#3743: 	#ame Maybe we should test how accurate the fire support from Pleiku artillery base is!
#3744: 	#ame  Let’s get over that bridge. Follow me. Quickly. 
#3745: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, we made contact with VC unit approximately squad size, fortified in French bunkers. All enemies KIA with negative friendly casualties. Over.
#3747: 	#ame Roger Six. Shrew One out.
#3786: 	#ame So this is what a VC tank platoon looks like?
#3787: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Roger. We’ll check out this AO. Over.
#3792: 	#ame Take us up to those French bunkers. We’re gonna check ‘em out. 
#3793: 	#ame Get us up to those French bunkers.
#3794: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One. We’ve found the tanks - they’re useless wrecks though. Made contact with large VC group. Over.
#3796: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Roger that fire support. We will try to clear the area. Shrew One, out.
#3797: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One, we have found enemy trenches and bunkers, made contact with small VC unit. Possibly more enemies in this AO. I'm gonna pull my men out, over!

#3831: 	#ame Yeah! Come get some!
#3833: 	#ame Hey Vista Alpha, we are here. 
#3838: 	#ame How's it been up here?
#3840: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Vista Bravo. Over.
#3842: 	#ame Six, this is Vista Bravo. We relieved Vista Alpha on hill Seven One Five. Over.
#3844: 	#ame Six, this is Vista Bravo. Roger that, out.
#3845: 	#ame Shit!
#3850: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Vista Bravo. Over.
#3852: 	#ame Six, this is Bravo. We had a small VC group making a move on the wire. Enemy bodycount not possible. Over.
#3854: 	#ame Take it easy...
#3860: 	#ame Nhut, take point. Leave this area and move south. We have to find Shrew Three. 
#3861: 	#ame Continue to Shrew Three’s position.
#3865: 	#ame Check your weapons, and get in to defensive positions!
#3866: 	#ame Six, this is Vista Bravo. Wilco. Out.
#3870: 	#ame Alpha Hotel, this is Vista Bravo. 
#3872: 	#ame Six, this is Vista Bravo. We are under almost constant attack. How much longer are we gonna be stuck up here? Over.

#3875: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Vista Bravo. Over.
#3877: 	#ame Six, this is Vista Bravo. Enemy still pushing forward. Need that support ASAP. Over.
#3879: 	#ame Six, this is Vista Bravo. That's great, tell them to hurry, out.
#3881: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Vista Bravo. Over.
#3883: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Bravo. Wilco. Be advised, Charlies are waiting, expect hot LZ, over.
#3890: 	#ame What the hell's wrong with you... Let's get the fuck outta here, ASAP!
#4000: 	#ame On point, we’re headin‘ west, better stick to the stream bed.
#4001: 	#ame Alright, Defort? Let's get that chopper outta here.
#4011: 	#ame OK - lead the way!
#4012: 	#ame Continue along the stream!
#4013: 	#ame Keep movin‘!
#4022: 	#ame Shit, VC have boobytrapped the LZ.
#4023: 	#ame Let's go, the trap’s disarmed, you're on point.
#4028: 	#ame Alright, quit that chatter!
#4030: 	#ame Secure that goddamn moaning, and get your fat asses in gear!
#4031: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. Landing zone was boobytrapped. We are on blue line. Over. 
#4036: 	#ame Here we go. 
#4039: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. Roger that. Out.
#4040: 	#ame We‘re heading to the Bahnar village. Planned route will take us through the stream bed of the Khe Bana river.
#4041: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike. We made contact with the enemy. Probably a boobytrapping squad. 
#4042: 	#ame The rest withdrew to the West. Over.
#4044: 	#ame Six, this is Spike. Wilco. Out.
#4045: 	#ame The way through the stream looks blocked, we should find another route through the jungle. 
#4052: 	#ame Dammit, take cover, and return fire!
#4053: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike. We had another contact.
#4054: 	#ame They are only trying to slow us down. Over.
#4059: 	#ame Six, this is Spike. Roger, continuing to mission target. Out.
#4061: 	#ame Shit, we can’t get through here.
#4064: 	#ame Alright, let's take to the trees and find a way through the jungle. We need to get to that village.
#4071: 	#ame Lead us to the village, Nhut.
#4072: 	#ame Find the way to the village.
#4073: 	#ame Let's get to this goddamn village.
#4100: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fist Alpha, do you copy, over?
#4102: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. Our slick crashed in the jungle, chopper crew KIA and will need pickup. We are in the jungle near the target area, we can hear gunfire, but can't see shit. Over.
#4104: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. Roger, we are moving to the area. Out.
#4110: 	#ame Right, let’s take this hill.
#4113: 	#ame Go up.
#4114: 	#ame Move up!
#4115: 	#ame Hi guys, you're Fist Delta, right?
#4117: 	#ame Chopper crash?
#4119: 	#ame Right, let's get up that hill. Leave one man here with the wounded, the rest of you are coming with me.
#4121: 	#ame Shit! He bought it.
#4123: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fist Alpha, we found Fist Delta. They've got several WIA, and the radio is gone. They also report a slick down in the target area, possibly with Fist Bravo on board. Over.
#4125: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. Roger. What about the wounded? We need medevac. Over.
#4127: 	#ame Roger Six. Fist Alpha Out.
#4136: 	#ame Get to it, Doc.
#4137: 	#ame Take us up this hill. 
#4138: 	#ame Let's get up there. Gooks are waiting for us. 
#4139: 	#ame I got this aerial photo of the region. It shows the area in detail after the bombing. 
#4140: 	#ame I’ve drawn some grid squares, so I can use the photo for navigating fire support.
#4146: 	#ame We should find another way to the top. 
#4147: 	#ame We gotta get up there.
#4148: 	#ame Nhut, look for a path up the hill!
#4150: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fist Alpha. Over.
#4152: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. We’ve found the wounded from Fist Bravo. Two of them. Also two KIA. We really need that medevac, over.
#4154: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. Attack the hill with a single squad? Over.
#4156: 	#ame Roger Hotel Six. Fist Alpha out.
#4159: 	#ame Maybe we should check this tunnel out. Let’s call the Captain.
#4162: 	#ame OK, we need to be at the top of this hill!
#4164: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fist Alpha. We are half way up the hill, but we can’t find a way to proceed. We just found an entrance to a VC tunnel. Over.
#4166: 	#ame Roger that Six, Fist Alpha out.
#4167: 	#ame I‘m going in. You guys stay here and wait for the back-up teams. Defort, stay in touch with the Captain. 
#4168: 	#ame This hill is riddled with gook tunnels. 
#4169: 	#ame Shit! This is a massive NVA base underneath a goddamn hill. How the hell are we gonna take this!
#4174: 	#ame We’re runnin’ outta time, dammit. Where's Fist Charlie?
#4177: 	#ame I'm glad to see you guys! Let's go. We got a bitch of a hill to conquer!
#4178: 	#ame Nice view from here. 
#4180: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fist Alpha. Over.
#4182: 	#ame Six, this is Fist Alpha. The bunkers are still occupied by the enemy. We really could use some support. Over.
#4184: 	#ame Roger, Hotel Six. Fist Alpha, out.
#4190: 	#ame Mmmm, I’m gonna scope it out.
#4191: 	#ame Hmm, this tunnel should lead up the hill.
#4204: 	#ame Pack leader Six, this is Foxhound. Come in, over.
#4206: 	#ame Six, damn ceiling collapsed behind me! I can’t go back! Over.
#4208: 	#ame Six, this is Foxhound. I found a group of NVA. They disappeared through the well in one of the rooms. They must have some alternate escape route, sir. Over.
#4209: 	#ame SHIT! Cave-in!
#4211: 	#ame Damn it, I ain't gettin' through here...
#4216: 	#ame Nobody home?
#4221: 	#ame Pack Leader Six, this is Foxhound. Understood. Out.
#4222: 	#ame Nice bunk! The gooks have got themselves a nice setup down here.
#4223: 	#ame Buckets of rice! That'll feed a unit for weeks.
#4224: 	#ame The NVA are well equipped in this area, it's these guys we gotta worry about...
#4225: 	#ame Mary mother of God! There's enough ordinance here to blow the side off of this hill!
#4226: 	#ame Pack Leader Six, this is Foxhound, do you read me, over?
#4228: 	#ame Fuck, this just gets better and better.
#4230: 	#ame That well looks like the only way outta here. Shit.
#4232: 	#ame This is not my idea of fun.
#4233: 	#ame Holy shit!
#4234: 	#ame Shit! I almost broke my legs!
#4235: 	#ame And I lost my goddamn weapon!
#4239: 	#ame Grenade!
#4240: 	#ame Hmm... There's some light down there. 
#4241: 	#ame Fuck it! They got away.
#4242: 	#ame Shit man, some of them got away. At least I zapped some of the bastards!
#4247: 	#ame What do we have here!
#4249: 	#ame Fuck me, I can't take much more of this.
#4251: 	#ame The gooks must've escaped through this tunnel here.
#4252: 	#ame Looks like another freakin' dead end.
#4253: 	#ame Seems like my lucky day! I should try to make a radio call.
#4254: 	#ame My God, what a stink! Remind me what the fuck I'm doing here?
#4255: 	#ame Dry ground. At last. 
#4256: 	#ame Hmm.... I got a good feeling about this tunnel, I should check it out.
#4257: 	#ame Christ! The water level's way too high, these tunnels are full.
#4258: 	#ame Maybe I should see if this leads anywhere...
#4259: 	#ame Oh, that water's nasty, I'll probably die of cholera... If I ever get out of there...
#4260: 	#ame Shit, here's the place where I fell down!
#4261: 	#ame Damn, I'm right back at the start again.
#4262: 	#ame This is where I fell down in to this stinkin' pit!
#4263: 	#ame Theres no way I could climb back up there...
#4264: 	#ame What the hell did I do to deserve this? Crawling around like a stinkin' rat!
#4265: 	#ame Jeez, it's like a maze.
#4266: 	#ame Why the hell did the VC dig out such massive tunnels?
#4267: 	#ame Fuck it. I'm lost, all the tunnels look the same.
#4268: 	#ame There's gotta be some way out.
#4269: 	#ame Damn tunnels.
#4270: 	#ame Jesus, how much longer can I spend crawling around in this shithole?
#4271: 	#ame Who the fuck built such a stupid set of tunnels?
#4272: 	#ame I'm gonna be spendin' the rest of my life down here.
#4273: 	#ame These tunnels are drivin' me crazy!
#4274: 	#ame I can't handle much more of this.
#4275: 	#ame Shit, how long have I been talking to myself, I must be freakin' out!
#4276: 	#ame Maybe I should draw up a map.
#4277: 	#ame I gotta stop wandering in circles, need to find a way of remembering where I've been.
#4278: 	#ame I'm just wandering randomly down tunnels, I gotta start gettin' my head together...
#4279: 	#ame I am completely lost. I gotta search these tunnels more systematically.
#4280: 	#ame I'm screwed. Hey, maybe I could make some marks with my knife?
#4281: 	#ame Hey, I can mark the walls with my knife!
#4282: 	#ame I gotta stop wandering, and start searching properly.
#4283: 	#ame Oh Yeah! Maybe I could use the lightsticks.
#4284: 	#ame I could drop a lightstick on the crossings to mark the tunnels I've already searched.
#4285: 	#ame Shit! The lightsticks, they could be handy now.
#4286: 	#ame Shit, I should really search these crappy tunnels.
#4287: 	#ame There must be some way through the submerged tunnels!
#4288: 	#ame I'd better search the underwater tunnels properly. 
#4289: 	#ame I wonder if I can hold my breath long enough to get through there. There's one way to find out...
#4290: 	#ame I bet the exit is somewhere in the underwater part of the tunnels.
#4300: 	#ame Nhut, get us outta this shitty swamp! Our target is point Baker.
#4301: 	#ame On point, Nhut.
#4302: 	#ame Lead us to point Baker.
#4303: 	#ame Everyone cool? Defort get that bird outta here.
#4311: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Swamp Fox. We are still far away from the objective and we've found a VC hut. Over.
#4313: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox. Roger, out.
#4314: 	#ame Empty!
#4316: 	#ame Damnit! This area should be clear.
#4317: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox. We found a VC guard post. Over.

#4319: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox. Roger that. Out.
#4320: 	#ame Good night Gracy...
#4321: 	#ame Holy Shit! That must've woke 'em up all the way back to Utah!
#4323: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox. We can see a VC guard. Somethin' ain't right. I got a bad feeling about this... Over.
#4325: 	#ame Six. Roger. Swamp Fox out.
#4326: 	#ame Eat that, you son-of-a-bitch...
#4327: 	#ame Jesus, they'll know we're here now!
#4330: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox. We have found an enemy position, from Baker up one. It looks like a cargo transfer point and it seems pretty hot. Over.
#4332: 	#ame Six, roger that. Swamp Fox out.
#4334: 	#ame What is it, Nhut?
#4338: 	#ame Shit, the gooks in the village must have heard our gunfire. 
#4341: 	#ame We gotta keep our heads down, and avoid any dust-ups.
#4348: 	#ame Nhut, lead us through these bushes and continue to point Baker. 
#4351: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox, do you copy? Over.
#4353: 	#ame We're close to point Baker. Proceeding according to plan. Over.
#4355: 	#ame This is Swamp Fox. Roger Six, we'll float like ghosts. Swamp Fox out.
#4359: 	#ame Stay here. I will try and get him quietly.
#4362: 	#ame Down! Take cover!
#4365: 	#ame OK, we’ve got to take care of these two. Nhut, you come with me.
#4366: 	#ame Cover us.
#4367: 	#ame Take the one on the right.
#4370: 	#ame It went smooth.
#4372: 	#ame So there are three gooks guarding the whole camp.
#4373: 	#ame Camp fire with a couple of gooks sat around, and huts with some others asleep...
#4374: 	#ame There's our man. When I approach, I'll signal Bronson and he'll blow one of the huts.
#4375: 	#ame During the chaos, I'll grab our guy and bug the fuck out of here.
#4376: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox, we are at point Baker, going to proceed as planned. Have Bird and Dragon ready for use. Over.
#4378: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox, don't worry about us! Out.
#4379: 	#ame OK peckerwood, let the party begin.
#4380: 	#ame Hey man! You OK? Follow me quickly. We need to bug out!
#4381: 	#ame Shhhh. It's OK, follow me we'll get outta here.
#4388: 	#ame Six, this is Swamp Fox. We've got our man back. What's the status on that extraction at Lima Zulu One? Over.
#4390: 	#ame Roger Six, Swamp Fox out.
#4392: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Swamp Fox. We lost contact with the enemy. We need pickup ASAP. Over.
#4395: 	#ame This is Swamp Fox. Welcome Dragon One. We're already outta there. Go ahead and get that teaparty started. Over.
#4400: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy? Over.
#4401: 	#ame Hotel One, this is Shrew One, do you copy? Over.
#4402: 	#ame Goddamn tunnels, I gotta find a way out.
#4412: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy? Over.
#4414: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Negative. I'm in the middle of the jungle and it feels like at least a klick away from the tunnel entrance.The jungle is swarming with gooks. Over.
#4416: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, Roger that. I'm moving out now to the east, out.
#4418: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Do you hear me? I’m at the pickup point. Over.
#4420: 	#ame Shit. I'm gonna catch one before they get here...
#4451: 	#ame Heads up gentlemen... Somethin's up...
#4452: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Swamp Fox. We are still a distance from the objective, and we've found a VC hut. It’s empty but looks used. Gooks must’ve been there recently. Over.
#4453: 	#ame The whole area‘s flooded. We need to follow the azimuth over to point Baker. Nhut will lead us there. 
#4455: 	#ame Yeah, gladly.
#4456: 	#ame We need to get to point Baker. Nhut will lead us. 
#4457: 	#ame Nhut, lead us to the LZ above the village. And be careful, we gotta stay undetected. 
#4458: 	#ame Continue quietly to the position above the village. 
#4459: 	#ame Nhut, lead us to the target. 
#4460: 	#ame I'll take the one on the left. Let’s go.
#4461: 	#ame We need to get to the position marked LZ if we wanna see the village from above.
#4462: 	#ame I’ll find the POW, grab him and get him the fuck outta there. 
#4463: 	#ame We need to get to the Lima Zulu double time... 
#4464: 	#ame Good to see the sky again, even if it is black and cloudy.
#4465: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Shrew One, do you copy? Over.
#4467: 	#ame Six, this is Shrew One. Negative. I'm in a VC village at the tunnel entrance. Made contact with the enemy. All VC eliminated. The area is swarming with gooks. Over.
#4468: 	#ame VC sign?
#4469: 	#ame Roger Six, Shrew One out. 
#4504: 	#ame Defort! Better ask base about Spike Two's status.
#4518: 	#ame Screw it, Doc, we are needed somewhere else. Hold tight, this is gonna be a rough ride!
#4526: 	#ame And it seemed like such a peaceful morning. Lock and load, guys.
#4548: 	#ame Get the outpost up!
#4564: 	#ame Outta the way!
#4602: 	#ame Head for the stream. Stay sharp.
#4608: 	#ame Yeah, I reckon they knew we were comin' ever since we inserted.
#4610: 	#ame Continue along the stream bed.
#4611: 	#ame Follow the VC along the stream bed.
#4620: 	#ame Shit!
#4621: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. 
#4624: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One, we engaged a group of trailwatchers near checkpoint blue with negative friendly casualties, over. 
#4626: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One. Negative, we will continue, out.
#4640: 	#ame Nhut, find us a less busy way through.
#4642: 	#ame OK, let’s do it.
#4643: 	#ame Shit, we should try to find a different way round.
#4651: 	#ame OK, let's haul ass straight to the village! Nhut, lead us up to the third canyon.
#4700: 	#ame Mountain Eagle. This is Fox One. The pass is blocked. Proceeding on foot. Over.
#4702: 	#ame This is Fox One. Hold Tight Mountain Eagle. We’re on our way. Out.
#4708: 	#ame Let’s continue on foot. Nhut, lead the way.
#4712: 	#ame Mountain Eagle, this is Fox One. We can see the outpost from here! Over.
#4714: 	#ame Mountain Eagle, this is Fox One. Will engage ASAP. You guys just keep firing. Over.
#4720: 	#ame Mountain Eagle. This is Fox One. The mortar teams have been neutralised. Over.
#4722: 	#ame Mountain Eagle. This is Fox One. Check your fire. We are moving up to the outpost. Over.
#4726: 	#ame Shit, it's not over yet!
#4730: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Fox One. We are at LLDB outpost. Over.
#4732: 	#ame Six, this is Fox One. We have repelled a large VC force. The main group are now retreating. Over.
#4738: 	#ame Fox One out.
#4739: 	#ame Six, this is Fox One. Roger that, sir. Out.
#4741: 	#ame Can we call in air support?
#4743: 	#ame Right. The only option is to go and light up those mortar teams ASAP!
#4749: 	#ame Quickly, to the oupost. 
#4750: 	#ame We need to find these mortars. Nhut, proceed downhill and keep an eye out for the VC. 
#4751: 	#ame Look for the enemy mortars. 
#4752: 	#ame We must destroy the mortars. 
#4753: 	#ame There are still some enemy mortars in the area. We need to find them all and destroy them.
#4754: 	#ame Let’s find the rest of the mortars. 
#4755: 	#ame Nhut, proceed to the next enemy mortar. 
#4756: 	#ame Now we should move to the Outpost. Nhut, lead us there.
#4757: 	#ame Let’s move to the Outpost. 
#4800: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. We’ve left the blue line and are heading through the jungle. We’ll try to reach point Makrel from the south east. Over.
#4804: 	#ame Shit, we lost him...
#4811: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One. Proceeding through jungle, lost contact with VC and heading towards point Makrel. Over.
#4817: 	#ame Hold your fire!
#4819: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One. We got our eyes peeled. Out.
#4820: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. We are now about one klick down from point Makrel. We just lit up some enemy. 
#4821: 	#ame Rest of the group seemed to have bugged out. Over.
#4823: 	#ame Six, this is One. Wilco. Out.
#4825: 	#ame We’ll try and flank north-west through the jungle to get to the Bahnar village.
#4827: 	#ame Continue to the village. 
#4828: 	#ame Keep movin‘! We should get to the village soon.
#4830: 	#ame Looks like Charles camped here last night - the fire is still warm.
#4832: 	#ame That’s exactly what we should do.
#4842: 	#ame Shit, poor bastards.
#4850: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. We are about half a klick from the target. We found three Montagnards KIA. Over.
#4852: 	#ame Six, this is Spike One. Wilco. Spike One out.
#4853: 	#ame Continue to the village.
#4854: 	#ame The Bahnar village is south of here, down in the valley.
#4855: 	#ame Lima Zulu is in the clearing on the left bank of the stream. 
#4861: 	#ame Don’t think so much. Just stay calm.
#4870: 	#ame Shit, we’re too late. Fucking VC!
#4880: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. We reached the village, but it's been torched! Over.
#4894: 	#ame Let's attack 'em from behind. Lead us around the stream Nhut.
#4895: 	#ame Go around the stream. We will try to ouftlank them.
#4896: 	#ame Proceed cautiously. We gotta get round the back of ‘em!
#4900: 	#ame I’ll call for an air strike.
#4901: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Spike One. Heavy enemy resistance. The whole village is hot. We need air support. Over.
#4903: 	#ame Roger Six, Spike One, out.
#4904: 	#ame Shit. We’re on our own for now...
#4910: 	#ame Take point. Let's find some Charlie!
#4912: 	#ame Scout for VC!
#4914: 	#ame Find VC!
#4916: 	#ame Stay sharp men! They're fuckin' everywhere!
#4921: 	#ame What now? Are they yanking my chain!
#4924: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Spike One. We manage to beat the enemy, but they're still around here for sure. We’re now moving to Lima Zulu. Over.
#4926: 	#ame This is Spike One, roger that, Spike One out.
#4930: 	#ame Double time it to the evac point, North of the village. Go!
#4931: 	#ame We need to get to the pickup zone ASAP.
#4932: 	#ame Lead the way to the pickup zone. MOVE IT!
#4941: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Spike One. Yellow smoke is affirmative. Over.
#5511: 	#ame What? Why?
#5513: 	#ame Huh? I don’t understand...
#5515: 	#ame But sir! It’s not fair! I have nothing to do with those pirates! I’ve paid big money to get here!
#5518: 	#ame Loud and clear. Over.
#5520: 	#ame Roger, Six. What are our orders?
#5523: 	#ame Loud and clear, Six. Over.
#5525: 	#ame Run? Can you send us some support? Over.
#5601: 	#ame Boobytrap!
#5602: 	#ame Hold up people, VC trap!
#5603: 	#ame Boobytrap! Watch out!
#5604: 	#ame Lay chilly boys - trap ahead!
#5605: 	#ame Come on baby!
#5606: 	#ame Shit - it’s a US grenade in a freaking beer can!
#5607: 	#ame Easy does it...
#5608: 	#ame Firesupport...
#5610: 	#ame Okay we’re clear let’s go!
#5611: 	#ame All clear, get movin’.
#5612: 	#ame Another one outta the way!
#5613: 	#ame Shit, that always makes me nervous man. Trap disarmed.
#5614: 	#ame Phew! I think I’ve done it. Carry on...
#5615: 	#ame Shit!
#5616: 	#ame Oops!
#5617: 	#ame Get the fuck...
#5618: 	#ame Oh shi...
#5619: 	#ame Motherfuck...
#5620: 	#ame I wanna send a sitrep!
#5621: 	#ame Fire up the horn, I need to send a sitrep.
#5622: 	#ame Defort, get on the radio I’m gonna send a sitrep.
#5623: 	#ame I’d better radio our situation.
#5631: 	#ame One VC KIA.
#5632: 	#ame Two VCs KIA.
#5633: 	#ame Three VCs KIA.
#5634: 	#ame Four VCs KIA.
#5635: 	#ame Five VCs KIA.
#5636: 	#ame Six VCs KIA.
#5700: 	#ame Nhut!
#5701: 	#ame Hey, Nhut!
#6500: 	#ame My name is Steve R. Hawkins, intelligence Sergeant. When I first arrived in Vietnam I got stuck in the rear for three boring weeks, serving as an instructor for the Vietnamese Special Forces at Nha Trang. 
#6501: 	#ame So, you said your name is Hornster? 
#6503: 	#ame Yeah, I’m here to replace the team’s Intelligence Sergeant, KIA. 
#6507: 	#ame So here it is... my new home.
#6539: 	#ame Yeah, Steve Hawkins, nice to meet you man. What you doin'?
#6555: 	#ame I’m Steve Hawkins, Intelligence Sergeant. I‘ve just arrived, still gettin' used to the place.
#6557: 	#ame Jeez, how did that happen?
#6565: 	#ame Sgt First-Class Hawkins reporting for duty, Captain Rosenfield sir!
#6568: 	#ame Roger that, Captain Rosenfield, sir.
#6570: 	#ame OK, sir...
#6572: 	#ame Wilco, sir.
#6574: 	#ame OK. Thanks, Captain.
#6606: 	#ame Before I knew it, I was on my first mission.
#6615: 	#ame What happened to that guy?
#6620: 	#ame I heard he got zapped on night patrol...
#6624: 	#ame Poor bastard...
#6626: 	#ame Sounds like a hot camp. You have to be careful what you ask for in this life don't you? Sometimes you might just get it!
#6660: 	#ame Fuck! Get us the hell outta here pilot!
#6674: 	#ame Not bad duty, really, but incredibly boring. Now, with that behind me I’m on the way to Nui Pek, a hot camp up in the Central Highlands, and a chance to see some action... Finally!
#6677: 	#ame So this is my new home for the next six months. Great. 
#6678: 	#ame Phew. I will sort my shit out later. 
#6679: 	#ame Now, time to get a proper weapon and do some shooting practice on the range. 
#6680: 	#ame This building in front of me must be the TOC bunker. There’s the flag. The Captain should be inside. 
#6681: 	#ame Must be the bunkhouse. This’ll be where the other GI’s sleep. 
#6682: 	#ame Ahh, this is the CIDG bunkhouse. The local’s trained in the camp chill here.
#6683: 	#ame Generator bunker. This bad-boy supplies the whole camp with electricity!
#6684: 	#ame I drew this plan of Nui Pek camp when I was in Nha Trang. I’m told it’s quite a big camp, constructed to support up to 300 CIDG soldiers inside. Should help me find my way around.
#8556: 	#ame Hello, Nhut!
#8559: 	#ame Really?
#8561: 	#ame Wow...
#8566: 	#ame Seems simple enough. What about fire support?
#8568: 	#ame Understood, sir.
#8573: 	#ame I‘ve heard that we have a high priority alert. What’s going on? Another attack?
#8575: 	#ame Shit. Really?
#8584: 	#ame No.
#8588: 	#ame Did you say three teams?
#8591: 	#ame And that third team?
#8594: 	#ame Roger that. We could use some LAW's though, Captain. 
#8600: 	#ame Goddamn tunnels, it's hell down there.
#8608: 	#ame A nice stroll through a swamp, and at night too, great. 
#8615: 	#ame Yeah, I got it, sir.
#8618: 	#ame Thanks, Captain. There’s nothing quite like a beautiful evening stroll through the swamp lit by moonbeams, and tracer rounds.
#8620: 	#ame Poets?
#8624: 	#ame OK? Who are these POETs?
#8626: 	#ame Of course! What are they gonna do? Talk to the gooks about their mid-life crisis?
#8628: 	#ame Sounds like fun! What then? 
#8630: 	#ame Sounds fair. We'll give them a chance, but if they really love the thought of being wasted by Hornster here, then so be it.
#8638: 	#ame Crocker, what the hell are you doing here?
#8640: 	#ame What? You want to leave the base now, at night? With all those reports of Charlie crawling around?
#8643: 	#ame Yeah, I feel loads better, I almost wanted to stay there. 
#8645: 	#ame I heard that something big's coming up?
#8647: 	#ame So, we're giving Charlie a taste of his own medicine?
#8649: 	#ame Shit. It would work, you know...
#8653: 	#ame Let me guess. Guard duty?
#8655: 	#ame What a great welcome back! I was kinda hoping for some action, get me back on the right frequency.
#8674: 	#ame Take it easy, man. Don’t forget that no battle plan survives the first contact with the enemy, I reckon we'll see plenty of action!
#8676: 	#ame Hornster?
#8678: 	#ame Shut the fuck up. You’re like a five year old. I'm telling you, there’s no way we’ll be sitting in the freakin' chopper all the time!
#8680: 	#ame Well I wouldn’t mind another stripe....
#8683: 	#ame Where?
#8685: 	#ame You thinking intel have made a mistake, like the one with tanks?
#8688: 	#ame So we're gonna fly there, fry some Charlies, if we find any, and get back?
#8697: 	#ame I hope it’s not a civic action, we haven't got the time right now for that kind of bullshit, Captain, we must...
#8701: 	#ame Shit. Regulars, not looking forward to meeting some of them...
#8703: 	#ame Sounds pretty hot over there... 
#8705: 	#ame We gonna land in the village?
#8708: 	#ame Great!
#8709: 	#ame Whats going on Sir? You promised me that leave, and I'm still here. There better be something big brewing!
#8711: 	#ame If you'd called me half an hour later, you’d have had to search the whole of Cholon. So what's going on?
#8713: 	#ame What?
#8717: 	#ame You think they might try to attack us here? Is it really that bad?
#8725: 	#ame Counter-attack maybe? We can handle it. Just give me few boys and....
#8728: 	#ame Bullshit, doc! We can take 'em. Hit ‘n’ run and...
#8730: 	#ame If that’s the case, it’s an ideal place for an airstrike.
#8732: 	#ame Bridge?
#8734: 	#ame So I’ll just sit on my ass in the chopper?
#8739: 	#ame What happened to you anyway, tough guy?
#8743: 	#ame What about reinforcements?
#8745: 	#ame I guess this is our chance to win some medals, or die a hero...
#1404: 	#ame Let's take those gook motherfucker's, Top!
#1532: 	#ame I‘ll go first.
#1603: 	#ame We did! We beat the shit out of 'em!
#1606: 	#ame Kill the bastard!
#1608: 	#ame I am going over to the left, you go right Hawkins!
#1610: 	#ame INCOMING!
#1627: 	#ame You got it, brother. Let's go!
#1705: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Eye Two. We have contact on the west, looks like a million gooks are coming at us, all NVA. Even if we kill 'em, we ain't gonna have space to bury 'em all! We're falling back. Over.
#1923: 	#ame Which will be blown to bits, the second we leave...
#1926: 	#ame And blow that motherfucker! I'm coming with you, man!
#3037: 	#ame Careful man, there’s VC shit on those suckers!
#3054: 	#ame Did you try adjusting the squelch break, Defort?
#3059: 	#ame Look at that mother go! Can you fucking believe that!
#3152: 	#ame What's happening, where is Snake Three? 
#3155: 	#ame Two minutes ago those sons o‘bitches were trying to grease us, man.
#3157: 	#ame We should waste 'em. Save the trouble...
#3167: 	#ame You must be joking, this is the most fun I’ve had since my wedding night!
#3174: 	#ame Cause we’re the meanest mother-fuckers in this goddamn valley! That's how!
#3421: 	#ame Fuck!
#3431: 	#ame Are these choppers made of fucking cardboard or what?
#3788: 	#ame Yeah! Let's rock 'n' roll, you motherfuckers!
#3813: 	#ame Another one.
#3815: 	#ame Kill ‘em all.
#3817: 	#ame Hawkins! Enemy mortar squad!
#3820: 	#ame Welcome to Cambodia. 
#3824: 	#ame Top, get those mortars or the relay is history!
#3826: 	#ame Jesus, Hawkins - what's the matter with you? Take those goddamn mortar teams!
#3847: 	#ame A nice little camp, with plenty of gooks to shoot! My idea of heaven!
#3855: 	#ame Have a nice ride home!
#3892: 	#ame Fuck you Bronson, let's get the hell outta here!
#3960: 	#ame VC comin' up the west side. Fifty meters!
#3961: 	#ame VC closing! West side fifty meters!
#3962: 	#ame Gooks comin up the west flank! Fifty meters!
#3963: 	#ame Gooks on the west flank. Fifty meters.
#3964: 	#ame VC west side, fifty meters.
#3965: 	#ame VC to the west. Fifty meters.
#3966: 	#ame VC west side, twenty meters!
#3967: 	#ame VC to the west, twenty meters!
#3968: 	#ame Gooks ahoy, over to the west. Twenty meters!
#3969: 	#ame Here comes chuck! To the west, twenty meters.
#3970: 	#ame VC to the west, twenty meters.
#3971: 	#ame VC west. Twenty meters.
#3972: 	#ame Gooks! Closing in, fifteen meters!
#3973: 	#ame VC west side, fifteen meters!
#3974: 	#ame Shit, VC nearly on my pos!
#3975: 	#ame VC west side fifteen meters.
#3976: 	#ame Here they come! West side, fifteen meters.
#3977: 	#ame Shit, they're closing on my position. Fifteen meters.
#3978: 	#ame VC, they're nearly through. West side of the hill!
#3979: 	#ame Shit, VC west side of the hill!
#4008: 	#ame Yeah, it's humpin' time again!
#4025: 	#ame Looks like Bronson's gonna get his feet wet!
#4038: 	#ame So where’s the usual goddamn reception committee?
#4058: 	#ame I prefer VC man, they put up more of a fight!
#4105: 	#ame Where is everyone?
#4111: 	#ame Why the fuck are they not fighting?
#4128: 	#ame Come on, pussies! Charlie's waiting for us, and we don't wanna disappoint those motherfuckers!
#4131: 	#ame Jesus, if we can only got here earlier... Poor bastards...
#4158: 	#ame That pussy? We're all tougher than him. Now let's get the fuck up the hill! 
#4171: 	#ame We gotta nail that sucker!
#4336: 	#ame Jesus! What the hell are these boats doing here? 
#4398: 	#ame I'm just glad you're both back in one piece. C'mon let's di di!
#4805: 	#ame Shoot the motherfucker, he‘s getting away...
#4806: 	#ame Let's do this! I’m getting itchy feet.
#4808: 	#ame If I find any, I’ll stick ‘em up your sorry ass, doc! How about that!
#4818: 	#ame Scratch one gook!
#4917: 	#ame Come get some motherfuckers!
#4927: 	#ame Looks like the mothership's gonna come take us home!
#6502: 	#ame That’s it! CJ. Hornster, weapon specialist. Is this your first visit to Nui Pek?
#6504: 	#ame Yeah Douglas, poor bastard, he ran out of luck.
#6506: 	#ame Oh man... That last three days of R&R in Saigon were just what I needed, but now I need a rest! I still hate coming back to this godforsaken AO. It’s going to take me a week to get back on frequency. Got way too relaxed there in Cholon, if you know what I mean, Hawkins!
#6508: 	#ame Hey!
#6510: 	#ame This is Hawkins, our new Intelligence Sergeant, he's PCS to the camp now!
#6512: 	#ame Take care man. Tell those REMF's at HQ to come out here and start earnin' their pay.
#6515: 	#ame Well, you wouldn’t believe what happened to me this time!
#6517: 	#ame I was in that bar we trashed when we brawled with those marines last time around.
#6519: 	#ame I met her again!
#6521: 	#ame Well, she dumped the major she’d been dating, said she wanted a real man!
#6523: 	#ame Yes siree! She was howling like a wolf! I ruined her, she'll never be satisfied by a man again. Hey D, I could teach you a thing or two about wooing the ladies...
#6525: 	#ame Ha ha ha! So what’s happening with our Montagnard friends?
#6527: 	#ame I’ll have to go check them out.
#6528: 	#ame Hey Hawkins, the Captain’s waiting for you.
#6529: 	#ame Go find the Captain, he must be somewhere around here. 
#6575: 	#ame Yo, Hawkins! Looks like you’ve found yourself a home here already. Why don’t you grab a weapon and follow me for some target practice.
#6576: 	#ame We got ourselves a bit of an improvised range here.
#6577: 	#ame This is where we train the CIDG troops.
#6578: 	#ame They're mostly local Montagnards here, mountain people basically. We train them to use weapons, so they can give Charlie a hard time. We give most of them carbines, since they are small people. Once they get some weapons training, they are pretty good!
#6579: 	#ame They're keen to learn, friendly and most of all, tough fighters. While most of us hug the ground with our buttons getting in the way, these dudes stand on their tip-toes during the firefight so they can find their targets! You gotta love ‘em. Unbelievably brave soldiers.
#6580: 	#ame You wanna do a bit of shootin'?
#6581: 	#ame You see that bottles over there? See if you can hit 'em!
#6582: 	#ame Hey Minh, didn't I say you can’t shoot accurately from the hip?
#6583: 	#ame You gotta aim before you shoot!
#6584: 	#ame Pull the butt firmly in to your shoulder. Then track your target through the sights.
#6585: 	#ame With the rifle in the ready position, you get a better idea of where your shots are going.
#6586: 	#ame Also, the weapon doesn’t jerk so much.
#6587: 	#ame That's much better...
#6588: 	#ame Didn’t I say the sights make it easier?
#6589: 	#ame Good job, Minh.
#6590: 	#ame Minh, kneel down now. Hide behind the obstacle.
#6591: 	#ame Try to shoot from the kneeling position. 
#6594: 	#ame Whoa, there's room for improvement there. I thought you could shoot?
#6595: 	#ame Uh oh, when was the last time you had a gun in your hand, Hawkins?
#6596: 	#ame Nice shootin' Tex!
#6597: 	#ame Good shot.
#6598: 	#ame Nice one.
#6600: 	#ame Hawkins, it looks like the Captain wants to see you. Don't keep him waiting!
#6601: 	#ame The Captain's calling you. 
#6621: 	#ame Right. I was out with him on night ambush. We were going after some VC tax collectors. It was a group of local VC who were stealing rice from the local ville. Villagers sent us a message, so we humped over there one night and ambushed those gooks just before they got into the village. Me, Douglas and a few of the yards. 
#6622: 	#ame They were so surprised they didn't even have time to wet their pants. After we blew the claymores they were all lying there, totally wasted. But when we went to check the bodies, another bunch came up on us. We had a dustup there for a minute. Then they di di’d, but Douglas was unlucky.
#6623: 	#ame Shit happens. At least it was quick. An AK round caught him in the head. He was out of it before he even hit the deck, man.
#6625: 	#ame Dunno, a few, mostly during the last attack on the base. Douglas, Peterson and Howard were the first Americans, but we also had some casualties from the Vietnamese SF and the CIDG's.
#6668: 	#ame Jesus, we ain’t gonna make...

#8576: 	#ame Whoa! This is going to be FUN, people! I haven’t killed a tank since...
#8578: 	#ame But today I will! You can bet your black ass on it!
#8581: 	#ame Shut up, short-ass, or you'll be leading the charge, with my bayonet up your keester...
#8596: 	#ame Grenades, man! All you need is a couple of grenades, and hey-presto, no more tanks!
#8601: 	#ame So next time let Defort go, he's small enough!
#8603: 	#ame Shut it, shortass!
#8605: 	#ame We gotta get him back!
#8616: 	#ame We’ll get him back in one piece, sir.
#8631: 	#ame Let's hope that they all think like that!
#8633: 	#ame What?
#8636: 	#ame Screw you, pussies! Better to be enthusiastic, than all fucked up in the head, like you guys.

#8661: 	#ame How?
#8673: 	#ame Fuck, this is going to be a good dust-up! Finally no skulking in the jungle, but a good old fashioned frontal assault, man, that’s great! BUT WHY THE FUCK ARE WE THE BACKUP?
#8675: 	#ame Nope, we’ll sit through the greatest battle of the war in the fucking chopper. Shit...
#8677: 	#ame Yeah?

#1758: 	#ame All units! --- between west bunkers three and four, move it!
#1759: 	#ame All crews respond. Attack between west bunkers three and four, they managed to place a bridge over the moat, you gotta ---
#1760: 	#ame All units, this is Six. Listen up, boys! Seems like most of their forces are trying to get through the west wire. If they keep coming this way, we'll bleed them dry before they have a chance to get inside. Out.
#1762: 	#ame All stations. Gooks are still attacking, mostly from the west, I'm sending a few guys to back you up! Keep it up! Out.
#1763: 	#ame All units, this is Six. Looks like they're backing off! Keep firing, don't let 'em get away! Out.
#1764: 	#ame This is Six. Fucking outstanding job there, guys. Over.
#1767: 	#ame All units, get in to some goddamn cover.
#1768: 	#ame All units, this is Six. How’s it looking? Over.
#1770: 	#ame Eye Two this is Six. I'm surprised they didn’t do that already, we have dustoffs incoming for wounded, maybe with some fresh troopers. Over.
#1772: 	#ame Eye Two, this is Six. I’ve convinced HQ we really need some help. Over.
#1775: 	#ame Howdy, Sparrowhawk, this is Hotel Six. Roger that, do it right now! Over.
#1777: 	#ame Sparrowhawk, this is Six... What’s going on? ---

#1783: 	#ame All personnel in west outer sector, this is Six. Retreat, I repeat, retreat. Retreat to the inner perimeter. We ---
#1791: 	#ame Eye Two, this is Six. Wait for our guys to get back, then blow the foogas in the main trench. Unless they're made of asbestos, they will have to run over open ground. Over.
#1909: 	#ame Mountain Lair, this is Hotel Six. Situation still the same. Part of the base is under enemy control, but we are holding. Any news on reinforcements, over.
#1911: 	#ame This is Six. Roger, Mountain Lair, if we have any? Are you fuckin' crazy! We'll hang... what in hell is this!? ...shit... ..oh no... that’s... 
#1912: 	#ame Mountain Lair, this is Six. We are under enemy armored attack, repeat, we have NVA tanks attacking our base! We have no anti-armour ordinance. Over.
#1914: 	#ame Mountain Lair, this is Six. We have several enemy tanks attacking --- One of them has parked in our main gates and is levelling everything --- We cannot hold against these guys. Over.
#1916: 	#ame Mountain Lair, this is Six. Negative. As soon as those tanks choose to enter the base, we're done for. If you cannot send us help in twenty minutes, we'll have to abandon the base! Over!
#1919: 	#ame Only way out is through the main gate, luckily most of these fuckers are in the west sector, there's only few near the gate...
#1921: 	#ame Shut up, Defort!
#1922: 	#ame If we blow that tank, we'll have a chance to bug out through the gate, while the gooks are searching the base. 
#1924: 	#ame Yep, our boys will destroy the base, then the slicks'll come for us. We gotta get rid of that tank, though.
#1927: 	#ame Negative, one man has a good chance of getting there, while the rest of us keeps our NVA friends busy. Steve, get some Charlie Four and place it under that damn tank.
#1929: 	#ame Morning Blaze, this is Hotel Six. We are evacuating the base, get some fucking napalm on there. Raze it to the ground. Over.
#1934: 	#ame Yes, he did it... 
#1935: 	#ame Ok boys, let’s move out. It will be pretty hot there in a while.

#3077: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Hotel Six. It's good to hear from you, what's the sitrep? Over...

#3132: 	#ame Excellent! We‘ll take ‘em back to base, you boys, however, won’t be going anywhere until you clear the rest of that swamp.
#3134: 	#ame Finish your sweep. When you get to the edge of the swamp, contact Snake Three. Snake One will remain to cover this area. 
#3136: 	#ame Affirmative. Arty at Firebase Glass will assist you. They are on the Black Knight PUSH and the call sign is Black Knight Sixty Six. Use Papa Oscar Makrel on your map to adjust their fire. 
#3138: 	#ame Good. Now go get 'em! 
#3139: 	#ame You boys, however, won’t be going anywhere until you clear the rest of that swamp.
#3141: 	#ame This is Six. Roger, Snake Two. Continue mission. Over.
#3144: 	#ame Snake Two, this is Six. Roger that. Forward air controller aircraft has spotted a large enemy group to the north. Snake Three should be able to handle them, but proceed with caution. Over. 
#3147: 	#ame Snake Two, this is Six. Roger that. Snake Three is in contact with enemy group, at least two squads. Over.
#3150: 	#ame Snake Two, this is Hotel Six. A large enemy group have broken through Snake Three’s position. They are converging on your location. Set an Alpha Bravo ASAP. Over.
#3171: 	#ame Snake Two, this is Six. Copy. Excellent work, Two. Snake Two meet up with Snake Three, we are sending the birds. Over.
#3201: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Hotel Six. Go ahead, over.
#3203: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Roger. Stay sharp, VC might be near. I'm sending slicks, be prepared to pop smoke. Over. 
#3207: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. I have reports that the area has beaucoup VC activity. Continue to the north, LLDB will pick you up somewhere round there. Over.
#3216: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Hotel Six. What's your sitrep? Over.
#3218: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Roger that. I have another plan for you. There is an LLDB river camp up the river. Try to move in this direction. We'll try to find a way to extract you. Over.
#3233: 	#ame One, this is Six. Well done Hawkins but stay alert. There's beaucoup activity around the blue line. Over.
#3293: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Hotel Six. Just got a message from the bird, Hawk One. Still no sign of our MIA, damn. Good to hear your still alive Shrew One. Over.
#3294: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Hotel Six, we thought you'd been zapped! What's your sitrep, over.
#3296: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Roger that, we have several units searching the whole area. There are more VC in this AO than we expected, over.
#3318: 	#ame Fist Alpha. This is Six. Read you loud and clear, what’s your status, over.
#3321: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Six. Do you have any casaulties? Over.
#3323: 	#ame This is Six. Roger that, Fist Alpha. Leave one team member at the exit and proceed to the ruins. Find a good position and call me from there. If you encounter any AA guns, blow 'em, there should be two somewhere. Over.
#3340: 	#ame Fist Alpha. This is Six. Good job. Looks like we finally broke through their defences, reinforcements are on their way. Over.
#3342: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Six. I'm afraid they’ll run before we have a chance to get there. They know they’re finished, so they’ll try to burn everything. 
#3343: 	#ame Sergeant, I need you to sneak through the base and find the commanding officer - he may have maps or documents we want. They may also be holding some of our boys on the complex. You know your job, so do it, soldier. Just try to come back in one piece. Over.
#3345: 	#ame Fist Alpha, look out for their escape route. They must have a way out. Good luck. Six out.
#3378: 	#ame Fist Alpha. Great job! We should be there any minute now. Begin clearing the remaining area of enemy. Hotel Six out.
#3400: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Hotel Six, what's your Lima Oscar Charlie? Over.
#3402: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Six. Have you seen any enemy down there? Over.
#3404: 	#ame This is Six, roger that, Red Bird, stay in contact. Out.

#3444: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Six. Move to sector 24 dash 11 and insert Hawkins there. Over.
#3446: 	#ame Red, this is Six. I don’t want too many people down there. Hawkins is experienced enough. The rest will support them from the air. Over.
#3447: 	#ame This is Six. OK, Hawkins, take a radio with you so that we can stay in touch, use call sign Fox One. Over.
#3449: 	#ame Fox One, this is Six. Good luck Hawkins, bring us back that pilot.
#3478: 	#ame Red. Roger. Six out.
#3500: 	#ame Interesting people, these Montagnards. It was a great idea to train the CIDG troops from these tribes. They are really brave fighters.
#3501: 	#ame And if you wanna find out something about Victor Charlie, the Montagnard village is a good place to ask. They’re not afraid of VC, like regular Vietnamese villagers. In fact they hate them! Am I right, doc?
#3503: 	#ame What in God's name are you doing?
#3504: 	#ame You idiot! Hawkins, if you don't know how to drive the jeep, you should say so! Now we have to go by foot!
#3505: 	#ame Alpha Hotel, this is Six. Hawkins crashed the jeep, we are continuing on foot. Tell Bronson to prepare the second jeep, we'll need to pull this one back to camp. Over.
#3507: 	#ame Roger, out.
#3508: 	#ame Now let's go. It's not far away. Follow me.
#3511: 	#ame This place got torched about a month ago. No one survived. The men of the village were with their wives and kids up in the CIDG camp, so Charlie took revenge on the farmers and elders who stayed in the village.
#3512: 	#ame Bastards! We got most of ‘em after the attack, but you know how it is, you zap one, and there’s another three lined up ready at the border.
#3513: 	#ame The village chief is probably going to invite us for a drink of the local favourite, Rice wine. If that happens, be a good boy and drink it , even if tastes and smells like gas!
#3514: 	#ame It might actually contain some alcohol. Right, doc?
#3516: 	#ame And here we are, village of the Jarai tribe. 
#3517: 	#ame Stop here.
#3519: 	#ame Ok, Crocker, do your stuff.
#3520: 	#ame And you Hawkins, follow me. Let's meet the village chief.
#3521: 	#ame Over there, the man with the white hair. I'll introduce you.
#3523: 	#ame Chao! 
#3524: 	#ame This is our new soldier, chief.
#3526: 	#ame Let's go. Drink up, and pretend you like it.
#3527: 	#ame Shit! Hawkins, looks like Charlie’s giving you the traditional welcome. You ought to go say hello back. He must be hiding somewhere in that grove. Check for muzzle flashes, or smoke!
#3532: 	#ame Alpha Hotel, this is your Six. We have a VC sniper here, near the village, do you copy? Over.
#3534: 	#ame Hotel, this is Six. Negative, we'll handle this on our own. Out.
#3535: 	#ame I will cover you! Crocker move to the left.
#3539: 	#ame And you Hawkins, follow the Doc.
#3541: 	#ame Covering.
#3542: 	#ame Move!
#3544: 	#ame Changing magazine.
#3545: 	#ame Reloading.
#3564: 	#ame So what is the status?
#3570: 	#ame Good job.
#3571: 	#ame Excellent.
#3572: 	#ame Never mind.
#3573: 	#ame I think that’s enough fun for one day, let’s go drink some rice wine.
#3582: 	#ame Dammit! Get down! That sucker sounded like a Mosin round for sure! Gook sniper!
#3601: 	#ame Greetings to the Jarai tribe.
#3602: 	#ame We’ve brought some rice for you. Could you get your men to take it from our jeep?
#3604: 	#ame We had some rice for you guys, but we crashed our jeep on the road. Maybe your men could bring it here?
#3605: 	#ame And how’s things in the village of the Jarai tribe. Everything OK?
#3607: 	#ame The Jarai men who joined our CIDG program are doing well. They’ll make great soldiers soon.
#3609: 	#ame I have to tell you, our patrols have seen VC in the area. You must be careful. Maybe you should move to our camp?
#3612: 	#ame Medic! On me! We got a man down.
#3615: 	#ame Follow me.
#3616: 	#ame Hey Hawkins, get moving! Follow Crocker.
#3617: 	#ame Hawkins, go get that damn sniper. Be careful.
#3618: 	#ame Go go go, Hawkins.
#3619: 	#ame Shit Hawkins! What are you waiting for? 
#3711: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Maintain contact. Cross the river and attack their position. Shrew Two will provide covering fire. Over.
#3729: 	#ame Shrew, this is Six, I do not understand. Say again, over.
#3731: 	#ame This is Six. Argh, shit... Freakin' intel. Roger on the scrap metal, Shrew One. Over.
#3733: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. That's a negative on withdrawal. This AO is way too hot. You must find out what’s happening. If you encounter any large enemy concentration, call for fire support. Over.
#3736: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Hotel Six. Good. Keep me informed. Out.
#3746: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Shrew Three has also reported contact. This area is pretty hot. Continue your mission. Over.
#3795: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Maintain contact, I will send Shrew Two to your position. Call for fire support if needed, over.
#3798: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. That's a negative on withdrawal. Shrew Three is pinned down and needs your immediate support. Proceed to Shrew Three’s position ASAP. Over.
#3841: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. Over.
#3843: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. The weather is getting worse, no chance of air support at current time. Out. 
#3851: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. Over.
#3853: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. Good work guys, keep me informed. Out.
#3857: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. You did good, over.
#3871: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Hotel Six. Over.
#3873: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. Bad weather conditions complicate the Spike teams pick up. You gotta sit tight, I'm afraid, people. I'll let you know. Over.
#3876: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. What's up? Over.
#3878: 	#ame Vista Bravo, this is Six. Roger that. We just picked up the last Spike team. If the weather holds, the birds will be there to pick you up in a couple of minutes. Over.
#4032: 	#ame Spike One, this is Six. Roger, on blue line. Continue as planned. Over.
#4043: 	#ame Spike, this is Six. Roger that, just stay sharp! Over.
#4055: 	#ame Spike, this is Six. I don't like this... Continue to point Makrel. Over.
#4101: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Hotel Six, what is your status, over?
#4103: 	#ame We lost contact with Fist Bravo and Fist Delta, move to target area. Over.
#4124: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Six. Roger. We already lost a few slicks, they've got some AA guns up there. Get the survivors from Fist Delta and attack. We must clear that hill. Over.
#4126: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Six. That's negative, they'll have to wait, area is too hot for extraction. You gotta try and take the hill! Over.
#4151: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Hotel Six, over.
#4153: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Six. Negative, it would be suicide for the dustoffs. You must get to the hilltop and eliminate the enemy in the bunkers and AA guns first. Over.
#4155: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Six. Roger, Sergeant, reinforcements are on the way and we can support you with some mortar fire. Give us some co-ordinates. Over.
#4165: 	#ame Fist Apha, this is Hotel Six. Hawkins, get in that tunnel and check it out. The rest of the team will wait for reinforcements near the tunnel entrance. Over.
#4181: 	#ame Fist Apha, this is Hotel Six, over.
#4183: 	#ame Fist Alpha, this is Six. Fist Charlie are coming your way anytime now, Fist Echo and Foxtrot are attacking from the north. Over.
#4205: 	#ame Foxhound, this is Pack Leader Six, what's your sitrep, over.
#4207: 	#ame Foxhound, this is Six. That whole section of tunnel must have collapsed. You're stuck a fair way down. I’ll send some guys to try and dig it out. Over.
#4220: 	#ame Foxhound, this is Six. Try and find a route through, the whole hill is riddled with tunnels. We're looking for an exit topside. You're so deep, it'll take weeks to dig you out. Over.
#4227: 	#ame --- understand ---
#4312: 	#ame Swamp Fox, this is Six. This was not reported. The area should have been empty. Check it out but be careful, you don't wanna alert any hostiles. Over.
#4324: 	#ame Swamp Fox, this is Six. Stay cool. Continue on mission. Over.
#4331: 	#ame Swamp Fox, this is Six. Continue as planned. Over.
#4352: 	#ame This is Six, I hear you Swamp Fox. What's your sitrep, over.
#4354: 	#ame This is Six. Good Swamp Fox. Remember if the VC get on to you, they will kill our man. You MUST stay undetected. Do you understand? Over.
#4377: 	#ame Swamp Fox, this is Six. Affirmative on that air support. Good luck guys, over.
#4389: 	#ame Swamp Fox, this is Six. Great work. Slick will be there in a few minutes. Better hurry up. Swamp Cat reports beacoup charlie headed your way. Get to Lima Zulu One ASAP. Whole sector will be cleared by the Dragon. Over.

#4415: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Stay calm. Try to march to the east. You should cross a big lake in the valley. Behind it there should be a clearing with some old ruins. We're sending out a slick to pick you up. Over.
#4417: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. Roger, stay sharp, and good luck. Out.
#4419: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Six. We can hear you just fine. Shoot a flare to mark your location. Stay where you are. We‘ll get you outta there. Over.

#4512: 	#ame Fox One, this is Hotel Six, do you copy? Over.
#4514: 	#ame Fox One, this is Six. Bad news. Spike Two was ambushed, they have reported that a large VC group is about to assault the outpost! You're the only team close enough, drive there fast as possible, do you understand? Over.
#4519: 	#ame Fox One, this is Six, attack on the outpost just started. We are sending for choppers, but in the meantime, you and the outpost crew are on your own. Over.
#4520: 	#ame Fox One, this is Six. Get your asses in gear, you gotta get up there ASAP. I'm going up in a loach to monitor the situation from the air. Out.

#4812: 	#ame Spike One, this is Hotel Six. Roger that. Continue to the mission target. Out.
#4822: 	#ame Spike One, this is Six. Try to reach the target as fast as possible. There is a concentration of VC around the village. It doesn’t look good. Over.
#4851: 	#ame One, this is Six... Roger three Yards KIA. Sorry to hear that. Continue mission. Over.
#4881: 	#ame Spike One, This is Six, roger that. Try to find the VC responsible. Engage any targets. Out.
#4902: 	#ame Spike One, this is Six. Due to weather conditions, it is not possible to send air support at the moment. You’ll have to sort this out yourselves. Keep me updated. Over.
#5510: 	#ame Well guys, I know you were preparing for the next mission, but I am sorry. You are staying at home today. Mission was cancelled. 
#5512: 	#ame All choppers are grounded, seems like some fucking asshole computer pirate hacked few of them or what. 
#5514: 	#ame Me too. I don’t know exactly what it means, probably some commie stuff, but HQ was really pissed off. Dismissed.
#5516: 	#ame Well you can call at the hot-line, Hawkins, maybe they will tell you what to do. But now... get lost! 
#5517: 	#ame This is Six, do you read me? Over.
#5519: 	#ame Abort mission! We have reports of situation CPF, repeat situation is Copy Protection Failed! Over!
#5521: 	#ame Execute operation GTS, repeat Go To Supermarket. And set your radio to HOT-line and call for help. That’s all I can do for you. Six out.
#5522: 	#ame This is your Six, do you read me? Over.
#5524: 	#ame Situation is bad, guys. There is an elite enemy group called Fucking Asshole Computer Pirates moving your way. Abort mission and try to escape. Over.
#5526: 	#ame Negative. All choppers are moving cargo codenamed Original Copy to target Supermarket. We cannot send you anyone, you are on your own. 
#5527: 	#ame Try to call HOT line, maybe they could help you. Six out.
#6548: 	#ame Ah, here you are, doc. You met our new guy Hawkins? Take him to the jeep, we'll go do that civic action of yours.
#6566: 	#ame Welcome to the camp, Hawkins, we’re a couple of men short right now, and glad to have you.
#6567: 	#ame First off, since we are way out in the boonies here, Hawkins, we can cut the parade field crap effective right now. Don’t salute around here or you set me up, and whatever you do, don’t read a map while you are standing, or you’ll set yourself up! The VC snipers in this AO are about the best I’ve ever seen!
#6569: 	#ame Cut out the formal shit. We’re a different bunch here.
#6571: 	#ame This is your bunker, it's no Hilton, but it's all your gonna get. Make yourself comfortable. Put your baggage down and go grab a weapon from the shooting range. Hornster's over there, he’ll let you try it out.
#6573: 	#ame Why don’t you take a look around the camp. This afternoon, I'll give you a guided tour of the local area.
#6602: 	#ame You got your shit together already? Everything ok? Good. You can come with us on a nice, exciting, goddamn civic action.
#6605: 	#ame Their camp's not far from here, so let’s roll.
#6646: 	#ame This is our TOC bunker, the place where team meetings and briefings take place. Now follow me, I will show you your bunker.
#6648: 	#ame Come with me.
#6651: 	#ame Bird Three, this is Hotel Six. Maintain your heading. Stay alert. Over.
#6653: 	#ame Bird Three, this is Hotel Six. Maintain --- positions. Over.
#6655: 	#ame Bird Three, this is Hotel Six --- Bird Six should be right there --- over.
#6658: 	#ame Fist Bravo, this is Six. Continue towards target, watch your heading when --- over.
#6662: 	#ame Bird Six, what’s current status. Over.
#6667: 	#ame All stations. Bird Six is down! We have a bird down in the jungle...
#8550: 	#ame So people, we're all here. This guy is our new intel Sergeant, Steve Hawkins, I expect most of you have met him already. He ain't green and he knows his job. Probably better than most of you. 
#8552: 	#ame OK, we have quite a lot of evidence to suggest there's a large VC shipping route nearby, used for moving weapons, food and supplies. We think it's part of the Ho Chi Minh trail. We have bumped in to a few VC moving stuff in that area, but never found the main trail.
#8553: 	#ame I want to send another recon team into the area. This team will attempt to locate the supposed Vietcong route. I want Steve here to lead it.
#8555: 	#ame You’ll have three other men with you. Crocker, Defort and Sergeant Nhut here. He is going to be your pointman. His complete name is Le Duy Nhut, but we just call him Nhut.
#8558: 	#ame Nhut is one of the best LLDB soldiers we have here in camp. He’s going to be your pointman on the mission. I know you're not a newbie, but do not hesitate to ask Nhut anything. He even knows some of the VC personally!
#8562: 	#ame Your LZ will be right here. You will cross the AO in a north east direction. In the areas which the enemy regularly uses for transit, they build supplies caches. 
#8563: 	#ame If you manage to find the trail, make sure you keep your eyes peeled for these arms and food caches. Anything you find, search and then blow with C4.
#8564: 	#ame The route you will take will join the Song Nong river and end in a small Montagnard village. The village belongs to a Montagnard tribe that call themselves the Bahnar. 
#8565: 	#ame We are trying to persuade them to join the CIDG program. Talk to their local chief, Nhut here will translate, he speaks their language. When you reach the village, check the area just to be sure there’s no enemy around. When your sure it's safe, call for a chopper. It will bring the villagers some food and get you back to the base.
#8567: 	#ame Negative, there could be friendlies around. Unless the shit really hits the fan, you are on your own. I don’t wanna ruin relations with the 'yards with a couple of badly placed HE mortar rounds!
#8569: 	#ame Good luck, Steve! Hornster, you seem to have something to add?
#8571: 	#ame You, Hornster, are gonna check all the weapons in the armory. Get Bronson and a few of the CIDG, shouldn't take you any time at all!
#8574: 	#ame No, but this looks bad, I’m afraid. We’ve discovered enemy armour on a couple of air recon shots, from the area around Khe Bana river... Looks to me like NVA tanks.
#8582: 	#ame Can it! You can argue later, children. Now listen up.
#8583: 	#ame Somehow, they have managed to get them across the border. I don’t need to tell you what it means to have them so close to the camp, do I?
#8587: 	#ame So here’s the plan: This is where they took the pictures. It's on an old French road near the river. We will insert three teams in the vicinity of the tanks.
#8589: 	#ame Yep. You guys make up Shrew One backed up by Shrew Two, which is the CIDG support team. They'll be inserted on the near side of the river at these coordinates. Shrew Two will cover you guys. You'll be attempting to cross the river and moving to this elevation.
#8590: 	#ame You should find the remains of old French fortifications up there. This should make good forward OP to navigate fire support from Pleiku Fire base.
#8592: 	#ame Shrew Three is team A-253 from camp Plei Djereng. They will be inserted at co-ordinates 15/28 and will support the operation from the other bank.
#8593: 	#ame We might be facing heavy enemy armour, so you'd better be on the ball, and if we find those commie tin boxes, make sure that the arty is right on the button. Just in case, the Air Force is standing by aswell.
#8595: 	#ame My thoughts exactly, but we're shit outta luck. I requested some from HQ a few months back, but still nothing. So you have to go find 'em, call in the Arty and get the hell outta there. Let’s hope it does the job...
#8598: 	#ame Get ready. You're leaving in twenty minutes.
#8599: 	#ame Quite an adventure you've been on, Steve.
#8604: 	#ame The guy we lost on that damn French route, Sergeant Marvin Fisher, RTO from A-253, is probably held in this village. It’s near the area where you came out of the tunnels.
#8606: 	#ame And we will! A day operation is too risky. According to Intel, Steve got out of the tunnels, the whole area's spilling over with Charlie. They are using it as a base to distribute arms and supplies around local VC cells.
#8607: 	#ame So, you’ll go there tonight. We don’t have up-to-date maps of that area, so you’ll have to use your initiative, and Nhut. A slick will insert you a good distance from the village. You’ll have to find your way through the swamp and check the place out. 
#8609: 	#ame Yes, Steve, and you'll enjoy it! Most of the area is underwater, but Nhut says you should be able to find a route to the village. Just be careful, and if you find any VC, let them be. Your target is the village, and the element of surprise is vital! 
#8611: 	#ame Nhut will lead you to the village. Once there, Crocker and Nhut will maintain a position on the hill which looks over the village. Defort and Hornster will block the area between the village and the jungle.
#8612: 	#ame Bronson and Hawkins will sneak undetected into the village. Bronson, you’ll place a little explosive surprise nearby the house they use as a store, Hawkins, you'll locate and free our guy. Simple.
#8613: 	#ame Then, all you gotta do is get the hell outta there. The LZ is nearby the village, a huey will be on standby circling the area, so you should be out fast. We should have some air support ready, and Pleiku FSB are prepped, if you need the big guns.
#8614: 	#ame Everything clear?
#8617: 	#ame Well, boys, you did a good job on the last one!
#8619: 	#ame Feeling poetical, huh? Good, because you are going to co-operate with POETS on this next mission.
#8621: 	#ame After that attack on the village near the Khe Bana river, Charlie panicked and lost his head. They crawled out of their holes and we zapped 'em.
#8622: 	#ame We enclosed the remaining enemy soldiers in a heavily bombarded swamp. Your first task will be to replace the A-256 team there, and serve as a blocking force.
#8623: 	#ame Charlie will want to get out of that quadrant, but you must not let him. When there is a suitable moment, the operation will be interrupted, and we will let our POETS do their thing.
#8625: 	#ame Psychological Operations Exploitation Team.
#8627: 	#ame Well, sort of... We need a few captives to get some intel. POETs will try to persuade them that we'll treat 'em nicely, so long as they forget the struggle against the ^capitalist pigs^. Commies distribute some really good propaganda about us. Hopefully some of 'em will see sense and surrender...
#8629: 	#ame If all goes well, we will launch the second phase - search and destroy. The objective will be to eliminate the stubborn assholes who've remained in the AO and refused to surrender. Then you guys will search the swamp and join up with B team. 
#8642: 	#ame How was Saigon? I hope you’re at full strength now, Steve...
#8646: 	#ame Maybe. We have a few teams inserted in Indian country, in the Khe Areh valley.
#8648: 	#ame If you mean are we using guerilla tactics against him, well the answer is no. It’s recon teams.
#8652: 	#ame Yeah, yeah, maybe, but those teams are doing an important job there. We've established a small radio relay near the border, so we can keep in contact with them. It’s hot round those parts, but it's gotta stay operational until the recon teams have finished.
#8654: 	#ame Exactly. We are rotating teams, us, the Plei Me and the Plei Dereng camps. Today it’s your turn to babysit, and make sure Charlie doesn't get to the top.
#8657: 	#ame Don’t worry. Charlie tries at least one attack a day. You're gonna regret you’re not in Saigon anymore, Hawkins!
#8664: 	#ame Thank you, Colonel. 
#8665: 	#ame As most of you probably know, the way we are fighting this war isn’t the best possible. We are busy trying to defend the borders and protect the villagers around our camps, so the enemy usually has the initiative.
#8666: 	#ame But not this time.
#8667: 	#ame We have to strike at the source of our problems. We can kill VC one by one, but uncle Ho, up north, just sends us down some fresh targets.
#8668: 	#ame During the last week we had a few recon teams in Khe Areh Valley, some of you participated in those patrols. Those teams detected a few enemy fortified positions in that area. We chose one, on the hill named Po Tlong Karai, which we will attack. Not just to show them we mean business, mind you, but to completely destroy it and scare the shit out of them, so the few who survive, don't stop running until they reach Hanoi.
#8669: 	#ame On the top of the hill, there are some old ruins. They've reinforced 'em and now it serves as their local headquarters. The guys from intel are hoping for some real juicy stuff.
#8670: 	#ame So let’s get to the actual battle plan. Our attack will be preceded by aerial bombardment. All attack teams will be sent to the area in choppers. Main attack is a joint operation between the SF and LLDB, it will be carried out by troops from Pleiku basecamp, designated Hammer.
#8671: 	#ame Support and backup force will be SF and CIDG from Nui Pek, Plei Me and Plei Deireng camps. Their codenames will be Fist. 
#8672: 	#ame Now, specific orders for the individual teams...
#8679: 	#ame You did great on that last mission, Steve. Maybe you’ll get a promotion for that, who knows?
#8682: 	#ame Let’s forget promotions for a minute, right now we have another mission. Seems like some NVA have moved to our AO. I'm sending you on recon mission, but it’ll probably change to search and destroy. 
#8684: 	#ame Our Air Force have spotted some large enemy groups moving through the rice fields near the Khe Bana river. I am sending you there in a chopper for some air-recon. If needed, we have a few fighter bombers nearby with napalm. After that you’ll hunt the rest from the chopper, as there's little cover on the ground. Of course this all depends on whether there are any targets there.
#8686: 	#ame Maybe... We hit them so hard with those attacks on targets in the Khe Areh area, I doubt they could start a new offensive so fast. They have to recover from those casualties, and regroup!
#8689: 	#ame That's it! Chances are, it'll just be a small group of VC trying to cause some mayhem.
#8691: 	#ame What?
#8693: 	#ame I still don’t get you.
#8695: 	#ame Of course! Same thing they used to nail that huey in Po Tlong Karai! Well, better luck this time. If you don’t find anything from the air, check the villages in the area and get back. Get yourselves ready, slicks are on the way.
#8696: 	#ame Howdy, guys! I have another mission for you. You get to look after some old friends of yours - the Bahnars!
#8698: 	#ame Hammer Charlie as much as we can, I know. Don’t worry, I am sending you on recon to the area around their village, and you can bet your ass Victor Charlie will be hangin' around like a bad smell. 
#8700: 	#ame Nope. It’s NVA this time!
#8702: 	#ame Yeah. Those night mortar fireworks are definitely from NVA units. Bahnars have sent the word that uniformed Vietnamese are moving around. HQ sent a bird there, and you almost had another search and rescue operation on your hands. This time the chopper was lucky and managed to pull out.
#8704: 	#ame As hell, probably, or at least it's soon gonna be. You’ll take your whole team. Charlie must have at last one camp nearby, probably more. Check the area around the village, the Montagnards will appreciate it for sure.
#8706: 	#ame No. Phantom has Daisy Cut a new LZ this morning. It’s a few miles from village, you've just gotta follow the stream bed. Basically find ‘em and kill‘em, it's that simple. Your chopper is already on it's way.
#8707: 	#ame And by the way, Steve, you’ll get your leave this week. So don’t screw up.
#8710: 	#ame I'm sorry to have interrupted your leave, but we really need you here. The shit's hit the fan.
#8712: 	#ame It looks grim, Steve. I don’t like it. I don’t like it one little bit. NVA is on our backs. We had to evacuate the Jarai village and outpost...
#8714: 	#ame We had to abandon it, there was no way we could defend it.
#8716: 	#ame It was to close to call. At least we can now concentrate our strengths on defending our camp here!
#8718: 	#ame It’s worse than you can even imagine. We have a lot of wounded. Defort's in hospital and Hornster will join him soon.
#8720: 	#ame I’ve requested reinforcements. We currently have priority on arty and air support. I wanted HQ to send some guys here ASAP, but for now we're on our own.
#8722: 	#ame I managed to get dustoff for the worst cases, but I am afraid some of them will have to stay here, Doc, at least for while. Charlie's started a really big operation, there's activity across the whole sector.
#8724: 	#ame Affirmative, Bronson. These bastards are after our asses. We need to buy some time.
#8729: 	#ame Negative Steve. Maybe later. We got a chopper here, I need someone to take a look at the situation over the old LLDB outpost. I've heard reports of NVA regulars massing there, maybe getting ready to come this way.
#8731: 	#ame I agree. Air Force is sending two birds there. You’ll check the area around and designate targets for them. If Charlie is already on the move, slow them down. 
#8733: 	#ame You read my mind. If it looks as bad as I think it is, Air Force will blow the bridge. 
#8735: 	#ame Don’t worry, you’ll get your chance to play hero. Right, get goin', the chopper's waiting. Take muscle head with you. Slick can take him to hospital...
#8737: 	#ame That’s an order, big man! I know you think it’s a scratch, but that wound'll be green in a few days. I want you outta here, understood?
#8742: 	#ame Steve, better get your weapon and move to the trenches. They're coming, and there’s a fuckin' shit load of 'em!
#8744: 	#ame Air Force is sending some birds, but I doubt it'll be enough. HQ promised me a few extra CIDG units from nearby camps, but I don’t know if they’ll get here on time...
#8746: 	#ame Right, let's get going...
#3525: 	#ame Me like see every one soldier. Bac Si he work, but we drink wine.
#3603: 	#ame Thank you.
#3606: 	#ame Yes, yes. 
#3608: 	#ame They are strong brave fighters!
#3610: 	#ame No, we stay. VC no move the Jarai!
#3611: 	#ame Hey.

#1428: 	#ame Roger that Shrew, I'm landing at your LOC. On the way in, we saw some movement northeast from your location. Over.
#1490: 	#ame Our pleasure, Shrew One. Good luck, Dustoff out.
#1721: 	#ame Shit, they're here!
#1774: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Sparrowhawk One, I'm going to draw a circle, and hose down some of these motherfuckers outside your west wire! Over.

#3062: 	#ame Fist Bravo, this is Black Bird, we are close to your position, what is your status. Over.
#3065: 	#ame That's negative Fist Bravo, enemy is approaching. Over.

#3214: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Red Bird. I can't find a way in. No LZ near. I will...

#3403: 	#ame Six, this is Red Bird. That’s a negative. Area is clear. Over.
#3417: 	#ame Blue Bird, this is Red Bird. I see flames on your tail. Get that thing on the deck, before she blows! Over.
#3419: 	#ame Damn! We need to get the hell outta here, too much ground fire!
#3422: 	#ame What the fuck was that?
#3424: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Red Bird. Blue Bird has taken hits, and is attempting emergency landing. Say again, Blue Bird is going down. Ground fire is too heavy. We're leaving the area. Over.
#3426: 	#ame Six, this is Red Bird. Over some rice fields. Grid ref 25 dash 13. We’ve seen group of VC on the paddy fields. Over.

#3464: 	#ame Fox One, this is Red Bird. We see the pilot near some buildings South-East of the big hill.
#3465: 	#ame Fox One, this is Red Bird. We got a visual on the pilot, he's near some huts, over to the East.
#3466: 	#ame Fox One, this is Red Bird. We've seen him, he's at the farm on the East side of the hill.
#3467: 	#ame Fox One, this is Red Bird. We see him. He's North of the hill, in around some farm buildings.
#3468: 	#ame Fox One, this is Red Bird. I think we seen him! He's holed up, in the Northern most farm.
#3469: 	#ame Fox One, this is Red Bird. The pilot's near some buildings, South-West of the large hill.

#5465: 	#ame Good hunting, guys!
#5466: 	#ame Don’t get yourselves killed!
#5467: 	#ame Take off! Good luck!
#5468: 	#ame Kill them all, let god sort them out!
#5469: 	#ame Take care gentlemen.
#5470: 	#ame Come on, man, we don’t have all day!
#5471: 	#ame You scared or something?
#5472: 	#ame Hey, move it! We gotta bug out!
#5473: 	#ame Get movin‘ guys, what you waitin‘ for?
#5474: 	#ame You want help getting out, pops?
#5475: 	#ame Hey, buddy, you wanna fly back with us?
#5476: 	#ame Hurry up! Move out!
#5477: 	#ame About time.
#5478: 	#ame I thought you were gonna come back with us!
#5479: 	#ame At last!
#5480: 	#ame I’ll throw you out next time, I swear.
#5481: 	#ame That took a while... 
#5482: 	#ame Welcome aboard!
#5483: 	#ame Fasten your seatbelts, we are taking off!
#5484: 	#ame OK, take off!
#5485: 	#ame So how was your trip, guys?
#5486: 	#ame How was the hunt? Good?
#5487: 	#ame Don’t know how about you, guys, but I‘m sure looking forward to a beer.
#5488: 	#ame Come on man, we gotta go!
#5489: 	#ame Get your asses on board!
#5490: 	#ame What are you waiting for, GI?
#5491: 	#ame We gotta move! Get your ass in here!
#5492: 	#ame Hate to fly out without you, but if you insist...
#5493: 	#ame Hey... You coming with us?
#5494: 	#ame You definitely took your time.
#5495: 	#ame If you want to stay for a bit, just say so.
#5496: 	#ame At last, take off!
#5497: 	#ame Bad time, buddy. You scared of flying or what?
#5498: 	#ame Here we go. Finally!
#6505: 	#ame Yo! Nui Pek Camp is right ahead of us guys, get your stuff together, we don’t want to stay any longer than we have to! 
#6513: 	#ame Wilco. Don't work too hard GI, and keep your ass down! 
#6656: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Bird Six. We got Bird Three spotted, coming in from the East. I got beaucoup ground fire comin’ in. Over.
#6661: 	#ame --- Shit --- this is Bird Six ---
#6663: 	#ame I can’t maintain altitude. Losing power. Bird Six is going down!
#6664: 	#ame Hotel Six, this is Bird Six. Repeat. Losing power. I - shit... I'm going down ---
#6666: 	#ame FUCK! I can’t pull out of it. Argh!
#6671: 	#ame HOLD ON! We're goin' down!
#6675: 	#ame What you waiting for Hawkins?
#6676: 	#ame Out you get, soldier! We ain‘t hangin‘ around!
#3274: 	#ame Hightower, this is Hawk One, do you hear me? Over.
#3276: 	#ame Hightower, this is Hawk One. I have three targets, permission to engage? Over.
#3278: 	#ame Roger Hightower, I will wait for your orders, over.

#3282: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Hawk One. Where are you?
#3284: 	#ame Shrew One, this is Hawk One. Roger that, Shrew One alive and kicking, missing man not found. I will report that ASAP. Over.
#3416: 	#ame Red Bird, this is Blue bird. We've been hit by ground fire. Controls are going... Shit!
#3418: 	#ame Fuck! Red, I'm trying. Controls have gone... Can't hold her... Call Six...
#3452: 	#ame I'm OK. The team I had with me are screwed, though. Gooks have probably got there by now...
#4394: 	#ame Swamp Fox, this is Dragon One. Where are you. Over.
#4396: 	#ame This is Dragon. Roger Swamp Fox, we'll warm 'em up a bit. Out.

#5000: 	#ame Now I have some music for you folks, so listen while I prepare the hourly news. Enjoy it and stay tuned!
#5001: 	#ame Yeah, this was my favorite song, hope you enjoy it as much as I did! Now I have one song for guys at Ap Bac Bang, from their dead friend called Theyknowwho, who is currently really enjoying his R&R in Saigon! And here it is...
#5002: 	#ame I'll interrupt the flow of music just for a while people... The weather forecast has a really surprising revelation for all of us! It's going to rain today! Now, let's get back to the music...
#5003: 	#ame Now just friendly reminder for those of you who are going for little of R&R to Saigon or anywhere else. The R&R actually means Rest and Recuperation, guys, not Rape and Rampage...
#5004: 	#ame Goood morning people! I don't know about you, but I am one really lucky guy! I've just read letter from my wife. Or to be exact, from my future ex-wife! She dumped me and started dating my old friend. He's mean assh... ahem. He's as mean and nasty as an alligator with a serious case of rabbies, so I am happy for both of them. At least I can date those great girls in the bars without feeling any remorse. Yeah, life is great and so is this song coming now on our wavelengths. Enjoy!
#5005: 	#ame Hello people! Here I am again! Before I play some really great music, I want to warn you FNGs here in Vietnam. There is one nasty lizard here, no, it's not poisonous or something, it just makes funny noises. Yeah, I am talking about the famous F-lizard. So when you hear somebody shouting at you from the jungle, maybe it is not the Vietcong, but just this critter. I even heard about one new officer, who came here and he heard the lizard shouting at him. ^HEY! WHO WAS THAT!^ His sarge told him, ^It's lizard, sir.^ And the officer shouted: ^PRIVATE LIZARD! Come here at once!^ Yeah. It happens...
#5006: 	#ame Hello people, this is your favourite Double-J, your beloved Jonah Jukowski, just one normal, ordinary guy sitting and spitting on the mike. Yeah, you're still tuned to the best radio station in all of South Asia! And here comes the next track!
#5007: 	#ame And here's another request from a guy I met yesterday at a bar called KA-BOOOM, where the guys from artillery usually hang out. So this fella recognized me and told me he'd like me to play a song for him. When I asked him what he'd like, he told me, ^I DON'T GIVE A DAMN, JUST PLAY IT LOUD, BUDDY!^ Here we go!
#5008: 	#ame Hello, all you brave strong proud americans in uniforms! Usually I am the one who helps you out by playing the best music available to our great radio station, but right now I'd like to ask you one thing. I have this letter from one civilian from the good old US of A, God Bless America! And she asks me one question some of you could possibly answer for me. Is it right that when you were at home, your wife was your right hand and now in Vietnam your right hand is your wife? Well, considering things I sometimes see in those great bars here in the city, the best answer for her would be ^yes^, don't you agree? And now some more music...
#5009: 	#ame Now for some really interesting news! Most of you probably know that some citizens in our country kinda disagree with what's going on here in Vietnam! But there are still people who want to support and help us here! So the big news is that one tough old-timer, called Sam Bangs, just returned after two years of gold digging in the mountains to his town and finally learned what's happening here. He immediately reported to the nearest recruiting center, volunteering for service in Vietnam! He said to the recruiting sargeant: ^I know only one Vietnamese, she's a laundress, and she was always nice to me, so I've decided to help liberate her country from those ugly commies. I may look bit rusty to you youngster, but I am still in good health and experience is what counts! I was in the US cavalry for twenty years and...^ I really like this guy's attitude... Too bad that the Army refused this seventy eight old man his chance to help us. But who knows, maybe his example will shame those young Americans who disagree with our job here and will join us soon! This song is for you, dear old Sam. 
#5010: 	#ame ... Eh, hello, here's your favourite Double-J again. Pardon me, but I really feel sad and homesick right now. My dear mother sent me a package and a letter, which reads: Dear Jonah, I miss you sooo much, as much as you miss me I expect.. I wrote something similar to her about month ago ... I wanted to remind you of home, so I've sent you those cookies you always loved. Savour them and remember your old mother, who is impatiently awaiting your next letter... and so on. At first I wanted to eat those delicious cookies, but than I've changed my mind. I'll keep them to remind me home... And I am pretty sure that those almost a month old cookies that are as hard as rock could help me protect myself! Speaking of rock, here it is!
#5011: 	#ame And here is your beloved Double J again, with another incredible, unbeliavable story. So this old 'yard had heard a lot about Americans and their guns and tech stuff. So, he was a lumberjack and he decided to ask Americans if they'd be kind enough to help him somehow with their 'magic'. Of course they did! They gave him huge shining brand new petrol chainsaw. So the 'yard went back to the jungle and used his new tool. After he managed to cut down one tree, he was exhausted and nightfall was approaching. He was so angry because with his old saw and axe he could chop down at least three trees in the same time, not just one. So he went back to American camp and told sargeant who gave him the saw that the magic saw doesn't work. The Sargeant took the chainsaw and started it. 'Yard blinked in surprise and asked ^Hey Trung-si, what be all da noise???^ If this one was or wasn't real, it's up to you to decide, guys. Here's some music to help you think.
#5012: 	#ame Another real life story... Back in the US, one school Mrs. Teacher asked her class if any of them knows a story with a moral lesson in it. Little Joe raised his hand and said: 'My uncle Bob is a fighter pilot in Vietnam! A few weeks ago he was shot down and so he had to jump out of the plane. He had only a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and machete. He had already drunk the whisky in the mid air and threw it away before he landed in jungle full of enemy vietnamese. He then killed seventy two vietcongs before he ran out of ammo, so he threw machine gun away and started to retreat. He chopped a hundred and five vietcongs into pieces, but then his already blunt machete broke, so he threw it away and ran towards the base. There were still enemies nearby, so he strangled fifty three of them with his barehands before he managed to get to safety.' Shocked, Mrs. Teacher then asked little Joe what is the moral lesson in his story and Joe replied: 'Don't piss off uncle Bob when he's drunk!' And here's a song for the brave, although drunk, uncle Bob, USAF.
#5013: 	#ame So, a marine was falling back during a really fierce battle. His Lieutenant asked him: ^Hey, Marine, where are you going? Didn't you hear me say that we're outnumbered 4 to 1 ?^ And the Marine replied, ^I got my four, Sir.^ 
#5014: 	#ame Well guys, I wanted to tell you a great joke about the Marine Colonel and Green Beret Major, but some of them would be so angry that they would hunt me down kill me, so you just have to think about what this could've been about. But I will play some great music to help you think...
#5015: 	#ame Well guys, I was listening for a while to the sounds of our competitor from Hanoi. Oh man, I have a feeling that sometimes the stuff I tell you here must sound like rubbish, but when I heard the rediculous things THEY are trying to tell you... Oh man, do they really think someone on our side could believe them?
#5020: 	#ame Hello people! This is your favourite Double-J, Jonah Jukowski, on your favourite radio station! If you wanna hear the best music and the hotest news in Vietnam, you're on the right wavelength! And here's the promised music...
#5021: 	#ame War news, it seems that the North Vietnamese were celebrating the fourth of July too! The fireworks were pretty impressive, but not as much as ours. Well, that's probably because the Navy helped us with thier own bombardment!
#5022: 	#ame I hope you enjoyed the music folks. But now I have another one for you. And here it comes... Woof, grrrr, woof, I wanna be your dog!
#5025: 	#ame Hello people! For those of you who have time to enjoy our music, I have another great song prepared, I also have some good news. It seem that our brave Marines won the big battle in Que Son Valley! Although they are still fighting, the enemy is retreating. Good job Marines! From what I hear, that was one hell of a fight, you can be proud of yourselves for winning this one for the good guys!
#5026: 	#ame This is Jonah Jukowski with another news from the Quo Son Valley battle. Well, it seems that the fight is over and it really was as tough as you can imagine. We still don't have all casaulties counted, but the Marines were hit hard. But they were victorious although the odds were against them. The battered the enemy. If everyone would do their job as well as those guys the war would probably be over by now. I'll have some official news in the evening, so stay tuned... 
#5027: 	#ame Well, now I have some better news, in case you missed it. Both Military Affiliate Radio System Stations are on the air and they are relaying personal telephone calls to the States. Although you may have to wait for few hours before you'll be patched through, it's still better than nothing, eh? So if you need to call your girlfriend, your mum or anyone else, you can do it!
#5030: 	#ame Well people, this election stuff is really crazy, don't you think? Some of our guys saw the Vietcong prepared to wreak havoc around every corner, but it looks like everything went well. As we expected, Nguyen Van Thieu was elected. I'm letting you know just incase you've been on patrol for the last week... But that's enough politics, I have something far more interesting for you... the music!
#5031: 	#ame Now for some war news. About two weeks ago, on September the 8th, Company B, 3rd Battalion, 60th Infantry stormed a big Vietcong hospital in the Rung Sat Special Zone. They were met only by token resistance. Vietcong guards ran out just few mins after the shooting started. Company B easily captured the now empty hospital and seized tons of rice and loads of medical supplies, mostly of Russian or Czechoslovakian origin. One interesting fact is that the most of the rice was labeled ^Heart of Texas^! Really interesting, huh?
#5032: 	#ame Well, let's forget all the rice from Texas, the Vietcong, the war and everything else for a while. Relax and just enjoy the music...
#5035: 	#ame Hello Vietnam, this is your Jonah Jukowski with some great military news! HQ just handed us a scorecard from operation Coronado IV. The figures are really good. Only two americans dead and 28 wounded, but those guys managed to kill 98 Vietcong and seize over 180 guns! Good one!
#5036: 	#ame I am looking for some special music, so stay tuned and wait for a while. Where is it... Well, one thing I really hate about this country are the poisonous snakes. Did you hear about what happend in Long Thanh? About the bamboo viper who wanted to be huey pilot and got into one for a ride? Imagine, how you would feel if you found a viper in your chopper!? I can't say I blame the guys in the slick for one of the fastest landings ever witnessed and running, well... ah, here is that song. Enjoy.
#5037: 	#ame And the next song is for the Marines from the Con Thien who are now under heavy artillery bombardment. Those guys are having a really hard time there, from what I've heard there are shells raining from the skies even as I speak to you. It's already lasted for several days. Hold on guys! You in the Meatgrinder! We are with you!
#5040: 	#ame Good morning, Vietnam! Did you sleep well? Well, now it's time to wake up! But I can help you with some music though...
#5041: 	#ame So did the song wake you up? It's definitely better to be woken by a loud song rather than some incoming, right? By the way did you hear about the marine who was hit by RPG and lived to tell the tale? I didn't believe it myself, but a marine I met in a bar insisted his pal really collided with that blasted thing and it didn't go off. What a lucky guy! I hope he won't try his invincibility with an artillery shell or something!
#5042: 	#ame mmmm..Huh? (snoring), sorry, I was thinking out loud, about the news dispatch I'll have to read you later. Really! Well, never mind. 
#5045: 	#ame I have some good news for you guys who read science fiction stories! No, it's not about the big eyed, green monsters! There was a Saturn Five launch yesterday at 1900 our local time from Cape Canareval. That one serious rocket carried Apollo four into orbit and it's Command Module landed some eight hours later in the ocean near Hawaii. In case you don't know, Apollo's final destination is the Moon, yeah! There's going to be one really nice flag fluttering on the Moon soon enough, yeah!
#5046: 	#ame Yeah, travelling to the moon... Too bad that there is probably no Lunar princess to rescue, like in the stories some people are writing. But it also means there are no Moon Cong either! I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind some R&R in space. I need to loose some weight...
#5047: 	#ame It seems that the Moon is my favourite subject today. Do you know why? No? Me niether, so I've decided to play a moon song. And let's hope it's going to be exactly opposite...
#5050: 	#ame Hi guys! The next song is going to Sarge Steve, who's pretty, handsome and all of that other girlie stuff. A Green Beret fighting now somewhere in the Central Highlands. The girl who wanted this song had a really sweet voice. How I envy you Steve! If she's as sweet as her voice suggests, you're one lucky soldier! I hope you have a great time on your next R&R in Saigon! Now, enjoy the song!
#5051: 	#ame I hope you'll have more luck than the singer of this song, Steve. Ahem. Now, to for some serious bussiness. I was ordered to remind you of another danger here in Vietnam. We are speaking about the diseases. You know the stuff. Take your pills, talk to your doc, be carefull with the food and boil the water. Or else you're going to be one sorry sick soldier.
#5052: 	#ame Yeah. Health is not a thing to throw away guys. I 've just remembered the time when I caught a bug and... no, it's too disgusting to discuss on the radio. But you know what I mean don't you? The only thing that kept me alive then was the hope that I would die soon...
#5055: 	#ame So, are you all looking forward to Christmas? We have just one week to go! I hope Santa will bring me something nice... At least some new records for me to play to you people. But this one is still good enough, don't you think?
#5056: 	#ame For those of you who like basketball, I will remind you of current leaders of NBA. Boston leads Eastern division and St. Louis is on the top of the Western division. Yeah. If you wanna know more, don't forget to listen out tommorow for the big sport news.
#5057: 	#ame Now I have some more sports news for you: NHL Eastern division is being lead by Boston and on the top of the Western division is Los Angeles. I think Los Angeles have a great chance this year, they are holding onto the lead really well. But heh, we'll see folks.
#5060: 	#ame Hello Vietnam! How are you all doing in this new year? Personaly, I hope 1968 will be better than the 1967 and worse then 1969! Right now 1968 seem quite nice to me, but it's only 2 days old, so we can't be sure yet... But you can be sure on one thing! And that is: Your favourite Double J will still playing the best music on your favourite radio station!
#5061: 	#ame Although this year looks really nice, I hope the people at home will finally understand what is happening here. Yeah, you guessed right. There's about a half of million Americans in uniform in Vietnam now, but lots of people at home are still protesting against the war and aginst what we are doing here. This really saddens me. Let's hope the war will be over soon.
#5062: 	#ame Yeah, music, that's what I'm living for. Until I will find another girl brave enough to date me of course.
#5065: 	#ame Did you hear about the time when couple of Green Berets met two SEAL guys in the middle of the jungle? They've asked them, hey sailors, what the hell are you doing here? You should be swimming somewhere! One of the SEAL's replied: We don't need to swim all the time, we just need to be close to water. Oh yeah? And where's the water here? asked Beret. There's thick jungle all around us for miles. The SEAL smiled and told him: Well, why, I have water here in my canteen.
#5066: 	#ame I have the weather forecast for tommorow soldiers, It's going to snow! Oh, sorry, this is the weather for the States. Hmm. Well, expect alot of rain, but you already knew that didn't you? And now, let some music rain down across on our wavelengths!
#5067: 	#ame I wanted to give you some sports news, but I've kinda lost them somewhere, sorry guys. You'll have to wait for the hourly news. So I'd better put something on the airwaves worth listening to.
#5070: 	#ame The Tet holiday, the Vietnamese New Year celebration is near! I hope it's going to be calm during these days, I'm looking forward to some fun! How about you guys? But if the North Vietnamese have any brains in their heads, they will stop fighting for a while and celebrate too.
#5071: 	#ame Right now the VC and the NVA are still trying to harass our guys up there in the Central Highlands. A few of them really mean NVA units have even decided to attack the Special Forces camp there! Kick some butts, Green Berets! Yeah!
#5072: 	#ame So how's your mood, guys? Care for a little joke? How about this one: There are 100 kinds of snakes in South Vietnam. Ninety-nine of them are poisonous ... ... ... and the other one eats you whole.
